# Creativity & Innovation: Building Habits & Frameworks

## Adapted from [Disciplined Dreaming by Josh Linkner](https://www.amazon.com/Disciplined-Dreaming-Proven-Breakthrough-Creativity/dp/1611203074)

Linker's suggested framework for driving creativity in your everyday life and in your teams and organizations follows these 5 phases:

    * Ask:
        * Identify the problem you would like to solve
        * Ask questions (why? what if? why not?)
        * Explore possibilities
        * Awaken curiosity and awareness
    * Prepare:
        * Ensure you're ready to meet the challenge you've identified 
        * Warm up your creativity muscles
        * Create an atmosphere for yourself or your team that is fun, surprising, and primed for cultivating creativity
    * Discover:
        * Explore every avenue that might lead to creative ideas
        * Challenge the ideas of "We've always done it that way" or "This is our usual approach"
    * Ignite:
        * Allow your ideas to flow freely in order to see what sparks. 
        * Utilize different techniques (listed below) to generate ideas and turn those "sparks" into "fires."
    * Launch:
        * Put your brainstorming into action
        * Select your best ideas
        * Determine key metrics for measurement
        * Build an action plan to bring your ideas to life

    Challenge: Incorporate these 5 ideas into your planning for the personal project (BEE M3) and beyond: 
      * Associating: Finding connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.
      * Questioning: In addition to the 3 magic questions, ask yourself open-ended questions: what could...? How might...? If..., then what about...? Have you thought about...? 
      * Observing: Raise your level of awareness by observing what is happening in the world and then imagining what could be different. What could be automated?
      * Experimenting: Don't be afraid of failure. Experiment until you find the best solutions.
      * Networking: Networking is not just about finding a job. Instead, focus on finding diverse people whose ideas challenge your own thinking and expand your perspective. Seek as much diversity as possible, including diversity of age, gender, political view, educational background, career role, religious/philosophical perspective, and geographical location.
