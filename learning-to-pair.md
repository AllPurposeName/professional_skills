#Learning to Pair: Holding Each Other Accountable, and Giving Feedback

Pairing with other programmers is an essential agile practice, and building your pairing skills will help you be successful in projects at Turing and in the workplace. Learning to pair is about establishing a relationship with the person you’re working with. This starts with breaking down communication barriers and building trust within the working relationship. This session covers how to DTR (Define the Relationship), strategies for upholding expectations with your partner(s), how to have difficult conversations when group members break expectations, and how to give each other feedback. 

Refer to the [Learning to Pair slides](INSERTLINK) for this lesson. 

##Learning Objectives:

* Understand what DTR is and how to hold a DTR conversation
* Define your own expectations in a working relationship
* Apply strategies to hold your partners accountable
* Demonstrate how to address broken expectations
* Describe how to give each other feedback

##Deliverable:

* Include a DTR memo in your portfolio for at least one project 

##Defining the Relationship (DTR)
DTR refers to a conversation each student has with group partner(s) before launching into a project. During this conversation, group members set expectations for how to work together. Use this [Guiding Questions template](INSERTLINK) to guide the conversation. 

Establishing a relationship with your mentor should also include a DTR. Here’s a cheatsheet for planning that conversation. 

Take time to define your expectations:
###Examples:
* Define your strengths -- what do you bring to the table? 
* How do you want to collaborate with someone else?
* How do you approach problems?
* What do you want Git workflow to look like?
* How do you appreciate communication from others?
* Imagine that you might be working with someone with a very different personality than yours -- **how will you communicate your expectations so that you’re on the same page?**
* What is your schedule like? What work-life boundaries do you need to communicate to your partner?
* Come up with additional questions that you want to ask your partner


###Holding Each Other Accountable
* Memo: Documenting your DTR in a memo will provide you with a record of what you discussed to reference as the project goes on. Make it into a gist so that everyone from the group has it. 
* Stand Up: Start each work session discussing what you are each working on that day and what goals you hope to accomplish at the end of the work session.
* Retro: Hold regular retros to discuss what’s going well, what’s not going well, and what you should change as a group to make your project and team more successful.
* Re-DTR: In longer projects, review and readjust expectations midway through the project.

###Compromising with each others’ expectations
* Remember lessons from Improv:
	* “No” means that you’re pushing your own agenda
	* “Yes” means that you’re expecting your partner to do all the work of defining expectations (even if you don’t agree with these expectations)
	* “Yes and” means that you’re collaborating and building on each other’s ideas for the good of the group
* Beware of the Paired Project Fallacy: 
	* My partner is better than I am OR I’m not as good as my partner.
* Why is this a fallacy?
	* This is a fallacy because it discounts all the important skills you both bring to your partnership. 
	* If you don’t feel as strong in your technical skills, what are your strengths? How do your strengths balance out your partner’s? How can you contribute to the project management? What do you want to learn during this project to improve your technical skills? 
	* If you feel like you have stronger technical skills, teaching your partner will help you solidify these skills. Alternatively, what can you learn from your partner? 
* Bottom line: Paired project code is owned by the entire team. There is no room (and no time, considering your tight deadlines) for egos -- you are here to support each other. 

###Addressing Broken Expectations
When a partner is not following through on expectations, the first step is to work on yourself:

* How are you reacting?
	* Silence (avoiding the situation; passive aggression; using sarcasm). By not addressing the situation, it looks like you actually approve of what the other person did.
	* Violence (yelling; personal attacks). By reacting this way, it looks like you are hard to work with and are abusive when things don’t go your way. 
	* Fundamental Attribution Error. This error comes from an assumption that others are doing contrary things because it’s part of their makeup or that they don’t care rather than considering other potential motivational forces
* How to fix these reactions:
	* Humanize the situation: analyze why the other person could have broken these social norms
	* Consider the 6 Sources of Influence:
		* Personal:
			* Motivation (does the person want/not want to do this?)
			* Ability (does the person have the ability to do this or not?)
		* Social:
			* Motivation (peer pressure -- from teammates, instructors, etc.)
			* Ability (what help does your partner need from others?)
				* Think about how you’re contributing to the social aspect as well: pay attention to body language, tone of voice, etc.
		* Structural:
			* Motivation (deadlines, grades, etc.)
			* Ability (What is structurally holding you back? Do you need a better organizational system? Trello, waffle.io, etc.)

###Facilitating the Conversation
Now that you’ve identified a motivation behind your partner’s behavior, how do you conduct a conversation to change that behavior?

* **Establish safety**: you’re about to address something sensitive with another person and he/she may feel threatened in one way or another.
	* **Mutual Respect**: People feel unsafe when they don’t feel mutual respect
		* **Fix**: calm tone of voice, facial expressions, and using respectful language
		* Ask for permission to speak with your partner
		* Speak in private
	* **Mutual Purpose**: People feel unsafe when they don’t feel that there is a mutual purpose for resolving the problem
		* **Fix**: Phrase your conversation around the goals of the project instead of you vs. your partner
* Use Contrasting: “Don’t/Do Statement”
	* Example: “I don’t want you to think that I don’t value your ideas. You’ve contributed a lot of great ideas to the project. I do want to talk about how we could discuss ideas as a group before making a decision.”
* Describe what’s happened:
	* Start with **Facts**. What exactly happened? *Be careful of **NOT** inserting your opinion of what happened.* 
		* “We agreed that we would make big decisions together, but during the check-in, you told our instructor that you had already decided to implement that new feature before you discussed it with me.”
	* Describe how the incident made you feel: 
		* “When you said that, it made me feel like you didn’t value my input and that you weren’t taking our expectations seriously.”
	* **Ask** for the other person’s side: 
		* “What is your take on this?”
* Following up after stating your side:
	* Listen to the other person’s side 
	* Analyze the response & go back to the 6 sources of influence:
		* Is the problem due to **motivation** or **ability**?
		* Discuss consequences related to your **mutual purpose**:
			* “If we don’t make decisions together, our project will suffer.”
		* Discuss new expectations if the issue is motivation:
			* “It sounds like you made that the decision because you felt pressure from the instructor to have a new idea in place at the check-in. Let’s redefine our goals for each check-in.”
		* Discuss finding resources if the issue is ability:
			* “You made the decision because you couldn’t reach me. Let’s find 3 mutual times we can check in throughout the day.”
		* Create action steps:
			* Re-DTR: who will do what and when?
###Practice
**Scenario:** During DTR, Partner A and Partner B decided that you would have an end of day retro to debrief how the worktime went. But at the end of the first day, Partner A left abruptly right after Wrap Up and didn’t meet with Partner B to retro on the tasks. Then in day two, Partner A doesn’t have a task finished that was promised to be done. Partner B is worried about time and how to proceed when Partner A seems unreliable.
* What assumptions need to be addressed?
* How will you conduct the conversation?
* Debrief: what was easy or difficult about having this conversation? 

###Giving Feedback
Your feedback to group members should be guided by these 3 principles:

* Specific
	* General feedback like “you did good work in this project” is not helpful for the recipient. Specificities allow for people to hear exactly what they could improve in without any guesswork on their part. A more helpful example is something like this: “You did a good job with authentication because you remembered to cover all of the cases with both regular uses and admins, but you didn’t test for all of the edge cases in order to make sure we have good coverage.”
* Actionable
	* Similar to why feedback should be specific, feedback should be actionable so that recipients can make a concrete plan on how to improve. Example: “You did a good job with the last feature because you really were very communicative in your pull request, but you could really stick to the style guide in order to make sure all of our code is uniform.” The action step here is provided for the recipient here -- using the style guide -- in order to create uniform code in the next project.
* Kind
	* Hearing critiques of your work is hard! We all know that we need to improve, but hearing those critiques in a harsh way puts us on the defensive and could cause us to disregard the feedback, no matter how actionable and specific it might be. Giving feedback from a kind place ensures that everyone feels safe and supported. 
* When would you do it?
	* In the moment
	* End of project
	* For portfolio

###Receiving Feedback
Choices you have: When faced with hearing things that aren’t easy for you to hear, how do you react?

Check yourself for these warning signs:

* Silence (shutting down, reacting with sarcasm, changing the subject, denial)
* Violence (becoming defensive and aggressive in response to feedback, deflecting from the topic by resorting to personal insults/comparisons, etc.) 

Why do these reactions happen? 

* When you first hear the feedback, your mind begins creating a story about what the other person thinks of you and why he/she has given you this feedback. We’re responding with emotion instead of objective reasoning.

Next Steps:

* If you find yourself reacting with either Silence or Violence, try these next steps:
	* Slow down -- take a moment to remove yourself from the situation and reflect on what outcomes both you and your teammate want from this conversation (action steps to improve, a strengthened working relationship, etc.)
	* Reflect on your own behavior:
		* How would others interpret your actions?
		* Can you still have productive dialogue? 
	* Get in touch with your feelings: 
		* What emotions are causing me to act this way?
		* Use a rich vocabulary: you’re not just “mad,” you might be embarrassed or surprised. Try to be specific with yourself on how you’re feeling.
	* Separate facts from stories:
		* What is driving these emotions? 
		* What are the facts about what happened in the conversation? 
* After you’ve been able to react to the feedback without emotion, focus on Acceptance:
	* Express that you have heard the feedback and will reflect on it
	* Ask clarifying questions
	* Thank the person for being honest with you even though it was most likely difficult
