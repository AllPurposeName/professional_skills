###Objectives: 

* Understand and recognize the three triggers of feedback
* Define and understand the 3 different kinds of feedback
* Write out and deliver thoughtful feedback for your project partner

###Deliverable
Feedback for and from your project partners in your end-of-module portfolio

###Opening
Think about the last time you received feedback  

* What emotions did you experience when hearing the feedback?
* How useful was the feedback you received?

###Three Triggers
Read [Chapter One from Thanks for the Feedback](files/Thanks For the Feedback_Ch 1.pdf)

Discuss: 

* What are you taking away from this chapter?
* Which of these triggers resonates the most with you?
* What factors might make it difficult for you to move past this trigger?
* Is there value in thinking about feedback triggers?
* How does looking at feedback through this lens relate to your growth at Turing?

Write: 

* What next steps will you take to be more aware of your triggers when receiving feedback?


###Three Types of Feedback
* Appreciation (Meaning) -- thanks, I see your hard work
	* Relationship and human connection
	* Motivation
	* Authentic

* Coaching (Accelerate Learning) -- I want to help you improve
	* Learn, grow, change
	* Something is missing or something is wrong

* Evaluation (Know where we stand) -- How you measure up
	* Comparison, implicitly or explicitly, against others or a particular set of standards
	* Aligns expectations and informs decision making
	* Also the LOUDEST



###Group Reflections

* Which type of feedback will be the most difficult for you to accept? 
	* Why?
	* What could increase the value of this feedback for you?

* Which type of feedback will be the most difficult for you to give? 
	* Why?
	* What could make this feedback easier to give?

###Crafting Feedback for your partner

You'll be delivering Appreciation & Coaching. Evaluation will come from your instructors.

* Appreciation: What did you see your partner do that brought added value to your project? 
* Coaching: What advice do you have for your partner on improvement? 

**Example of feedback:** 
Thank you for your contributions, especially in styling of several of our pages in the last few days. The site presentation looks much better as a result. Thank you also for checking in with me before you began working on a new item. I know that you didn’t always feel strong with some of the more complex aspects of our project, and I think that may have caused you to communicate with me less. I feel like there were several times during the project where either you had a missing DB migration or very significant merge conflicts due to working off a branch with a head far behind our current dev_branch. I would suggest that you communicate with your future pairs more often. Committing and submitting PR's more often, even if it means smaller steps, would also help resolve merge conflicts along the way rather than letting them build into massive problems that take away from project time. In the last two days of the project, I feel like your contributions improved tremendously, and I very much appreciated the work you did.

###Deliver Your Feedback
Pair up with your partner from your project and give each other feedback. Read or paraphrase the feedback you wrote down. Take a pause before responding. Synthesize what you heard and ask any clarifying questions that you have. 

###Follow-Up:
In Module 2, you’ll receive Feedback II in which we’ll discuss how to get better at giving and receiving feedback.
