##Disciplined Dreaming Framework
To build your creative muscles, we’ll explore a step-by-step framework to help you grow and move towards innovative ways of thinking each time you approach a problem. The short-term goal is to give you strategies to drive innovation in your personal project and Mod. 4 projects.

* 5 steps to this framework (this session will focus on the first 2 steps):	
	* Ask
	* Prepare
	* Discover
	* Ignite
	* Launch
* Ask: Identify and clearly define your specific creativity challenge so you can direct raw creativity in a purposeful way. Ask questions, explore possibilities, and awaken curiosity and awareness.
* Prepare: Make sure you’re ready to meet the challenge identified. Prepare every aspect of your mind, body, and environment to support maximum creative performance.
* Benefits of using this framework to break down barriers to creativity:
	* Avoid costly mistakes of flawed ideas and measurement
	* Increase your ability to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty
	* Learn how to adapt more quickly and proactively to changes in the marketplace
	* Apply focused creativity to specific business problems of all shapes and sizes
* This framework will help you address these categories:
	* **Breakthrough Innovation.** Think: innovations that rewrite the rules of the game, such as the assembly line, the iPod, Google, Swiffer
	* **High-Value Change.** Think: significant improvements in product offerings, processes, or business approaches that drive tangible value, such as a new product add-on.
	* **Everyday Creativity.** Think: changes to the way you think and behave in everyday work, such as creating a more efficient way of getting something done or finding a new path to implementing a feature.

##Activity #1: Ask
Clearly defining objectives for finding a creative solution to a specific problem aka your Creativity Challenge

* Objectives:
	* Asking questions
	* Exploring possibilities
	* Awakening curiosity and awareness
* 3 magic questions:
	* Why? Discuss why things are done the way they are now
	* What if…? Explore fresh possibilities
	* Why not? Consider constraints
* Discussion: Describe what 5 companies do and pick 1 to answer these questions:
	* What problem is this company solving? Who is the target audience? Why this approach? What if another approach was tried (what other ways are there to solve this problem)? Why not do it this way (what constraints are there? How could you get around those constraints)
* Individual Reflection in your journal:
* Based on personal project ideas that you’ve started thinking about, answer these questions:
	* What is a problem I want to solve? What is the solution I’ve brainstormed? Who is the target audience?
	* Why? (Why is this the problem I want to address? Why is this the approach I want to take?)
	* What if? (What if I tried something different that hasn’t been done before?)
	* Why not? (Consider constraints) 
* Extension:
	* Complete the [Creativity Brief](INSERTLINK) or [Creativity Brief Lite](INSERTLINK) before the personal project starts

##Activity #2: Prepare  

* Objective:
	* Warming up your creativity muscles
	* Create an atmosphere that’s fun, surprising, and fertile for growing creativity
* Prepare: provide yourself and your team for an environment and culture in which you can be creative.
	* What helps you think of your best ideas and work your best? What environment helps you think best? How can you simulate that here with your peers?
* Beware of these 3 pitfalls:
	* Groupthink (using everyone’s ideas to appease the whole group even when they don’t work together)
	* Distractions (there will be other problems that surface -- don’t let them distract you from the main problem you’re trying to solve)
	* Over editing (don’t focus on mistakes during this step)
* Activity: Practice Round; Small Group Discussion
	* Directions: Get into groups of 4 or 5 and discuss this question: what are 5 ways we could improve education in our nation? Create an environment that allows ideas and discussion to flow. 
* Debrief:
	* What was that experience like? 
	* What could be done to encourage risk-taking amongst your teams in the future?
	* What kind of set-up or culture would you need to establish within a team or within an organization?
* Individual Reflection in your journal:
	* What or who has blocked your creativity in the past? 
		* Think about your environment, the people you’ve asked advice of, your habits. 
	* What inspires you?
	* What does it mean to be in an environment that encourages risk-taking? How can you create that kind of environment for yourself?
* Next Steps:
	* During your ideating for the personal project, allow yourself time to brainstorm outrageous ideas -- ones that may not work at first glance. Allow yourself to run with those ideas, exploring them until they “fail.” Reflect on how this process helped you take risks. 

##Discuss Discover, Ignite, and Launch
* Discover: Explore every avenue that might lead to creative ideas. Break free of the straitjacket of “We’ve always done it that way” or “This is our usual approach.” 
* Ignite: Allow your ideas to flow freely in order to see what sparks. Follow the [12 Ways to Strike Sparks of Creativity](INSERTLINK) or the 8 Commandments of Ideation to turn those sparks into fires.
* Launch: Put your creative ideas into action by selecting your best ideas, determine key metrics for measurement, and build an action plan to bring your ideas to life.
