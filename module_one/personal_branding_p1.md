---

Learning how to tell your story based on the channel you’re using to communicate is important for successfully conveying how you’ll contribute to a team and the tech community. Think about how you’d like to contribute your prior experience and career to the tech community. How would you like to use your skills as a software developer? In this workshop we’ll talk through how the resume, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Github all contribute to telling your story and will support your job search.

## Deliverables

- Working resume
- LinkedIn profile
- Twitter Account
- GitHub Profile

### Resume Learning Competencies

- Reorganize your resume to lead with technical skills and experience
- Analyze what experiences are most useful in demonstrating transferable and applicable skills for an entry level tech role
- Produce a resume with clear and concise language aligned with current tech industry standards

### Research
Take a look at a few examples before getting started:

 - [Example 1](https://www.turing.io/sites/default/files/resumes/josh_cass.pdf)
 - [Example 2](https://www.turing.io/sites/default/files/resumes/rose_a_kohn.pdf)
 - Don't be afraid to think outside of the box...Check out this [epic resume.](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/)

### Layouts
You can choose to set up a traditional resume use a template like this [traditional resume](http://visualcv.com/www/google-docs-resume-templates/), but you may want to personalize the style with a layout on [creddle.io](http://creddle.io).

### Content Inclusion
- Add a __Header:__ Name, phone number, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site (These should all be linked text, not the long URL strings)
- Add an __About Me__ section with the 1 - 3 sentence intro you created in [What's Your Story](/Your_Story.md)
- Add a __Skills__ section: Highlight your dev/technical skills first. Include any transferable skills in this section as well.
- Add a __Projects__ section. What are you proud of? Show it off!
	* Be sure to include the following four elements for each project on your resume:
		*	__What does your application do?__ What problem does it solve for the end user? Who is it built for?
		*	__In what period of time was it built?__ This helps set folks' expectations appropriately. A product built in two months should look a lot more polished than one built in two weeks.
		*	__What was your role in the project?__ Front end? Testing? Team lead?
		*	__Technologies used__ This might be the most brag-worthy part for you, but since this element is likely the longest of the four, leave it for the end. Go nuts - dive into what API's, frameworks and languages you incorporated.

	* Does each project on your resume link to a GitHub repo? Does the ReadMe for each project include screenshots of the application in action?

	* Think back to your countless experiences in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Would you even _consider_ trying out an application without screenshots to tell you what it looks like? Nope.
- Add an __Experience__ section.

	*	Lead with your position title, then the company name
	*	Use dates
	*	Each bullet should be value-driven rather than task-oriented.
	*	Answer the questions: _What did you accomplish in this position?_ or _What are you most proud of?_ rather than, _What were your boring day-to-day duties?_
- Add an __Education__ section to the bottom of the resume. Remove GPAs and list in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the least recent.

### Peer Review
Exchange resumes with (2) peers. Share written feedback that you can refer back to. Consider the feedback you would appreciate receiving to continue improving your resume, share constructive feedback.

### LinkedIn Learning Competencies
- Specify personal brand
- Identify transferable and new technical skills
- Tell your story effectively

### Content Update

- Edit your Headline to represent what you want to be known for rather than dependent on your most recent working title. Consider "Software Developer" "Web Developer" or you can combine your past experiences with new skills like "Software Developer \| Former Educator"
- Identify your location with the zip code of the location of your number one location choice so that you show up in searches where you're looking for opportunities.
- Edit your vanity URL using your first and last name. Don't use numbers in your vanity URL -- numbers can open you up to potential age discrimination.
- Add your past experiences. Descriptions should demonstrate transferable skills. These descriptions should be in a paragraph, anecdotal form rather than bullet points.
- Place the education section below experience. Include Turing School of Software & Design under Education to help other alums connect with you now and in the future.
- Move skills section to the bottom of the profile. These will help recruiters find you in searches.
- Add a summary that tells your story from a high level answering the following questions: Who are you (as a developer, teammate, individual, etc.), how'd you get here (why software development, why now, etc.), what's next? (what are your  long term ambitions/goals). Include your email in the summary so those who aren't able to directly connect can still contact you. Remember, to wrap up the summary with a call to action.
- Add your connections to build a network of at least 50 connections (but always aim for 500+ quality connections). Don't forget to add Turing staff:
