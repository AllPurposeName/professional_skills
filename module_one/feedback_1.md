# Feedback I: Building an Understanding of Giving & Receiving Feedback

[Slides for this lesson](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f0cDlu4u5ZnM0WjpCpPfBcCJ9n3qRknqYjaqh8DdJVs/edit?usp=sharing)

### Objectives:

* Understand and recognize the three triggers of feedback
* Define and understand the 3 different kinds of feedback
* Describe the process of how to navigate a feedback conversation
* Write out and deliver thoughtful feedback for your project partner

### Deliverable
Feedback for and from your project partners in your end-of-module portfolio

### Opening
Think about the last time you received feedback  

* What emotions did you experience when hearing the feedback?
* How useful was the feedback you received?

### Three Triggers
Read [Chapter One from Thanks for the Feedback](../files/Thanks For the Feedback_Ch 1.pdf)

Discuss:

* What are you taking away from this chapter?
* Which of these triggers resonates the most with you?
* What factors might make it difficult for you to move past this trigger?
* Is there value in thinking about feedback triggers?
* How does looking at feedback through this lens relate to your growth at Turing?

Write:

* What next steps will you take to be more aware of your triggers when receiving feedback?


### Three Types of Feedback
* Appreciation (Meaning) -- thanks, I see your hard work
	* Relationship and human connection
	* Motivation
	* Authentic

* Coaching (Accelerate Learning) -- I want to help you improve
	* Learn, grow, change
	* Something is missing or something is wrong

* Evaluation (Know where we stand) -- How you measure up
	* Comparison, implicitly or explicitly, against others or a particular set of standards
	* Aligns expectations and informs decision making
	* Also the LOUDEST

### Crafting Feedback
Follow this formula:

* **Open:** Define the purpose of the conversation
	* *What kind of feedback are we discussing?*
	* *What does the giver want to give me?*
	* *Is the feedback negotiable or final? A suggestion or a command?*
* **Body:** Two-way exchange of information, requiring you to use these skills:
	* Listening
	* Asserting
	* Managing conversation process
	* Problem-solving
* **Close:** Clarify commitments, action steps, and follow-up

### Open by Getting Aligned
* What do you need?
* What does your partner need to tell you?

* Examples:
	* You: “I’d like to hear what I did well in this aspect: __________.”
	* You: “I’d like to hear about what I could do better in terms of my communication skills with partners.”
	* Partner: “I want you to hear that you made a lot of improvements in building tests.”
	* Partner: “I want to suggest that you ask your next partner more questions when you don’t understand something so that communication can be more open.”

### Pair & Share
Meet with your partner and discuss your Opening
* What do you need to hear from your partner? Include both appreciation and coaching
* What does your partner need to tell you?

### Body: Four Skills to Practice
* Listening:
	* Asking clarifying questions -- both to the giver and to yourself
	* Ask yourself: what’s right? Why might they see this situation differently?
	* Beware of your internal voice -- are you being triggered?
	* Paraphrasing what you hear:
		* “What I’m hearing you say is that I could work on this…”
	* Acknowledging the other person’s feelings -- it’s hard to give feedback

* Asserting: Mix of sharing, advocating, and expressing
	* Asserting means adding your perspective; your job here is not to prove the other person wrong in their feedback. You should converse and provide your perspective on the particular situation
		* “I hear what you’re saying, but I don’t agree with that advice because…”
		* “I’m feeling underappreciated so it’s hard for me to focus on your feedback. I think we should discuss how I’m feeling in addition to the feedback itself.”
		* “I agree that there are things that I’ve contributed to this. I’d also like to look at the bigger picture together to understand how this situation built to this point.”
		* “I’m surprised by that feedback. I need to process it. Let’s discuss it again later.”

* Process Moves: Diagnose, Describe, Propose
Managing a conversation

	*What do you notice about this example?*

	“We’re both making arguments, trying to persuade the other, but I don’t think either of us is listening to, or fully understanding, the other. I know I’m not doing a good enough job of trying to understand what your concerns are. So tell me more about why this is so important to you.”

	There are 2 things to notice here:
	1. It’s an observation of an aspect of the process that is stuck or off track along with a suggestion for how to move forward
	2. It’s awkward -- probably no one would talk like this; this is an example of how you can referee a conversation -- pausing the action of the conversation to step back and consider how it’s going and how to correct course

* Problem-Solving:
Create possibilities for how the feedback could be used. How can you acknowledge the root of the problem without feeling like you need to overhaul everything?
	* Recognize the interests at play:
		* Your partner wants to help you
		* You want to help yourself
	* Generate options that address your needs as well as the feedback giver’s
	* Note: This is not a final determination on the feedback but rather a way to move forward

### Closing: Make Commitments
What will an action plan look like from this conversation?

### Writing the Feedback
You'll be delivering Appreciation & Coaching to pair partners. Evaluation will come from your instructors.

* Appreciation: What did you see your partner do that brought added value to your project?
* Coaching: What advice do you have for your partner on improvement?

#### Example of feedback:

> Thank you for your contributions, especially in styling of several of our pages in the last few days. The site presentation looks much better as a result. Thank you also for checking in with me before you began working on a new item. I know that you didn’t always feel strong with some of the more complex aspects of our project, and I think that may have caused you to communicate with me less. I feel like there were several times during the project where either you had a missing DB migration or merge conflicts due to working off a branch with a head far behind our current dev_branch. I would suggest that you communicate with your future pairs more often to help avoid these issues. Committing and submitting PR's more often, even if it means smaller steps, would also help resolve merge conflicts along the way rather than letting them build into massive problems that take away from project time. In the last two days of the project, I feel like your contributions improved tremendously, and I very much appreciated the work you did.

#### Personal Reflections 
Make a plan for how to solicit feedback from: 

* Mentor(s)
* Instructors
* Peers
* How does that plan look different depending on your relationship? 
* How can you facilitate this conversation to be really specific about what you need? 
* How can this plan help you circumvent possible triggers? 

Make a plan for how to give feedback:

* What do you want to work on in terms of giving meaningful feedback? How will you do that?
* What reservations do you have about giving feedback? What action steps can you take to build comfort with giving feedback? 

### Follow-Up:
* Deliver your feedback to your partner during your project retros by following open-body-close
* In Module 2, you’ll receive Feedback II in which we’ll discuss how to improve in giving more specific feedback and how to be aware of our blind spots and wrong-spotting feedback.
