# Module Three StrengthsFinder: Why are you here?

### Objectives:

* Describe how your strengths make you a likeable character in your own story
* Develop user stories to describe how your strength drives change in your life as a developer
* Create a vision statement to answer the question, "Why are you here?"

### Opening
As you learned in Personal Branding I in Module One, there are 3 questions that drive your development at Turing:

* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

Reflecting on the last two modules, use your strengths and team experiences to answer the question, “Who are you?” in high-level 1-2 sentences to share with the group.

Today, we'll build on that sentence(s) by working to answer the question, "Why are you here?"

### Storytelling
Why are we drawn to stories? Stories help us better relate to the world around us. As noted in [Improv-ing Agile Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Improv-ing-Agile-Teams-Constraints-Creativity/dp/0993301304), in software development, we can become more engaged if we harness the enjoyment and escapism that storytelling provides -- when we reimagine our projects as stories in their own right. 

When people hear a story unfold, they also develop increased empathy. We can also use storytelling to communicate who we are and why we're here pursuing this new career, so when potential employers hear your story, they are able to relate to you more. That is why learning to tell your story is an essential piece of your professional development.  

**Discussion:**

Pixar story artist [Emma Coats described the 22 rules](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) that drive storytelling, including:

	Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
	you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

* How does your shared strength influence your own story?
* How does your shared strength make you likeable? How can you describe that to someone else?

### User Story Practice

Within your small group, pick both a scribe and a timekeeper. You will have 15 minutes to discuss both your shared and differing strengths in regards to another narrative rule identified by Coats:

	You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.  

Characters seem more realistic to us when we can empathise with their pain and struggles, and the changes that a character goes through become more interesting to us.

Think about your story as a user story -- if we think of ourselves as users in our own stories, we can create stories that fully capture how to use our strengths to address our needs. 

**As a group, decide on a user story for each of your shared strengths by following this template:**

	As [someone with this strength], 
	I want [to use it in this way] 
	so that [a desired change results]

Here are some examples:

	As a person with strength in Adaptability, I want to utilize my flexible nature
	so that I can take on new challenges more easily each time they come up.

### Share Takeaways

Share your vision statement and how you can use your strengths to begin to put this vision into practice right now as a current Turing student.
