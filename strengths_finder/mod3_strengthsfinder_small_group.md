# Module Three StrengthsFinder: Why are you here?

### Objectives:

* Describe how your strengths make you a "likeable character" in your own story
* Develop and use user stories to build an understanding of your partners' strengths as well as your own when it comes to telling your story as a developer

### Opening
As you learned in Personal Branding I in Module One, there are 3 questions that drive your development at Turing:

* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

Reflecting on the last two modules, use your strengths and team experiences to answer the question, “Who are you?” in high-level 1-2 sentences to share with the group.

Today, we'll build on that sentence(s) by working to answer the question, "Why are you here?" through storytelling.

### Storytelling
Why are we drawn to stories? Stories help us better relate to the world around us. As noted in [Improv-ing Agile Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Improv-ing-Agile-Teams-Constraints-Creativity/dp/0993301304), in software development, we can become more engaged if we harness the enjoyment and escapism that storytelling provides -- when we reimagine our projects as stories in their own right.

When people hear a story unfold, they also develop increased empathy. We can also use storytelling to communicate who we are and why we're here pursuing this new career, so when potential employers hear your story, they are able to relate to you more. That is why learning to tell your story is an essential piece of your professional development, and our focus today will be continuing to pull out the story of **"why are you here"** using your strengths.  

**Activity:**

Pixar story artist [Emma Coats described the 22 rules](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) that drive storytelling, including:

	Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
	you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

1. **Write:** Reflect on your focus strength and what it means to you.
* When at Turing have you seen it in action? How did it help you overcome obstacles?
* How have you seen yourself grow with this strength?

2. **Share:** Pair up with someone with a different focus strength from yours and discuss the following:

* Give a brief summary of what your focus strength means to your partner.
* How have you seen your focus strength in action in the past? Recently? 
	When did it help you overcome obstacles? Give some examples.
* How does your strength make you likeable to someone else? 
* Use your focus strength to answer the question "why are you here?"

3. **Whole Group Reflections:** 
* What was easy during this discussion with your peer? What was difficult about it?
* Did it help you clarify telling your own story? If so, how?

### Taking on Each Other's Stories: User Story Practice
So far, both with the Flower Exercise and in the discussion you just had, we've been focusing on the past and how that has provided a foundation to answer the question "why are you here?" Now, we'll describe how to use our strengths in the present and future to show why we're here pursuing this new career. 

Using the information from your discussion with your partner(s), you will build 1-3 user stories (as time permits) for that person. These user stories are a response to 3 additional narrative rules from Coats:

	1. You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.  

	2. What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. 
	Challenge them. How do they deal?
	
	3. If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? 
	Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.

Consider: 

* How has your partner used this strength to overcome obstacles? This is an indication of how they will continue to overcome obstacles in the future.
* How can you challenge your partner to use the strength more?
* How might your partner want to move forward with building this strength?

Here are some templates you can follow as examples:

	As [someone with this strength], 
	my user wants [to challenge themselves in this way] 
	so that [a desired change will result]

	As [someone with this strength], 
	my user wants [to use that strength in this strategic way] 
	so that [their new career is successful in this way]
	
	As [someone with this strength], 
	my user wants [to show how to use that strength in this way] 
	so that [they can express why they are pursuing programming as a career]

And here are some examples of finished user stories:

	As a person with strength in Adaptability, my user wants to be an example of flexibility 
	and positive attitude so that other programmers can see the benefits of a growth mindset. 
	
	As a person with strength in Communication, my user wants to combine their talents and 
	interests in public speaking with their newfound knowledge so that they can speak at 
	conferences and inspire others. 
	
	As a person who is Strategic, my user aims to use this new career in software to create 
	new solutions to overcome obstacles.
	
Reflections:

* How did writing the user stories make you think about these strengths?

### Independent Reflection
Read through and think about the user stories that your partner came up with:

* Do they reflect you in an accurate way? Do they give you an idea of how you would answer "why are you here"?
* Is anything surprising about how your partner interpreted your story?  
* How else would you use your strength to describe why you are here?

Use these reflections to revise your answer to the question "why are you here?" in 1-2 high-level sentences.

### Share Takeaways
Share your user stories and reflections.
