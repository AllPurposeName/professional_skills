# Module One StrengthsFinder: Who are you?

### Objectives:

* Articulate how to use a particular strength by discussing it with someone who shares it
* Provide feedback and strategize on how to continue developing this strength
* Use your strengths to answer the question "who are you?"

### Opening
As you learned in Personal Branding I in Module One, there are 3 questions that emphasize your development at Turing:

* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

Being able to articulate your story by answering these 3 questions is an important skill to hone as you transition careers. Your StrengthsFinder sessions will focus on building this skill by examining your strengths.

In this session, we'll work on answering that first question "who are you?" 

### Individual Reflections
Spend 5 minutes revisiting the top 5 strengths that came up for you, and look back over your initial reactions that you discussed with Allison. Answer these questions in your journal regarding your focus strength for today:

* When you think about your focus strength, what do you like the most about it? 
* How would you use this strength to describe yourself?
* When is it a struggle to use this strength?
* Write down 10 (or more) words that come to mind when you think about how to describe this strength -- these words are not necessarily positive or negative; use whatever comes to mind. 

### Pair/Small Group Activity
Take your list of 10 words and pair up with someone who has the same focus strength as you. Share your top 10 and discuss which words you wrote down are similar and which are different -- how does this reinforce or change the way you think about the strength?

As a pair, decide on the top 5 words that are the most interesting or meaningful to help describe your strength and come up with a story to describe how to use this strength efffectively and when to dial it back. 

Consider:

* How will others know that this is something that you're good at?
* What circumstances warrant pulling back on that strength?
* How will you remind yourself to use this strength to your advantage?

### Whole Group Discussion
Each pair share their stories of what their strength means and how they can use it. 

**Debrief:**

* What feedback do you have for the way others groups described their strength? Do you have any questions or comments for them?
* How will you continue to build awareness around your strengths?
* How can you hold each other accountable in this development?

### Independent Reflection & Takeaways
Create and share a high-level sentence (or two) to answer the question â€œwho are you?"

Use these questions to guide your reflection:

* When you think about how you would describe yourself before you started at Turing up until now, how is the story different? How are you different?
* What have you discovered about yourself in terms of this strength?
