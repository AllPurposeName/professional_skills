# Module One StrengthsFinder 

## Objectives

* Increase awareness of your top 5 strengths
* Build understanding of how to use strengths effectively

## Opening (5 mins)
To help you develop your potential, StrengthsFinder curriculum follows a four-step process:

* Discovery/Awareness
* Development/Integration
* Application
* Relationship

Today's session will be focused on the Discovery/Awareness step in order to build an awareness of these strengths and begin to understand how to develop them further. This session will include a lot of learning from each other in order to increase that awareness through coaching questions and reflection. 

Allison's Strengths:

* Strategic
* Empathy
* Intellection
* Developer
* Input

## Individual Reflections (8 mins.)
1. Fill out a name tag with your name and 5 SF strengths
2. **Write:** Vision-Building: think about why you came to Turing. Then relate your strengths to that vision:
  * How might your strengths help you fulfill that vision? 
  * How does each strength describe you in that vision?
  * Considering how you describe these strengths, how do you want others to see you?
  * Are there any other strengths that are recommended for you to learn from? Keep these in mind for the activity today

For your first discovery activity, Allison will assign you to groups based on most commonly held strengths in the cohort.

## Discovery #1: Ice Breaker (5 mins)
Find someone with 1 strength in common with you (can also have groups of 3)
Discussion questions:

* Describe your interpretation of the strength to each other -- what similarities are there? What differences are there?
* What is particularly motivating or inspiring about this strength for each of you?

### Whole Group Debrief (2 mins)
2-3 groups share out takeaways

* Did anything surprise you from your discussion?
* How can you use your discoveries to further your development in this strength?

Transition: Pick the strength to focus on next: which one is difficult for you to see as a strength?

## Discovery #2: Challenge of Affirming Our Strengths (5 mins)
Find someone with a different strength in common with you (can also have groups of 3)

## Discovery #3: Complementary Strengths (5 mins)
