-Look over Johari Windows -- how have you already been using your strengths? In what areas, could you develop your strengths more?
-Students should give feedback/insight on how each other are using their strengths...could pair up according to teams they've worked in?

-Johari Windows & reflecting on feedback in terms of strengths: 

0. Opening (5 mins)
1. Reflections: work on Johari Windows/look at them to first reflect on own experience of using strengths in team settings. Then decide any specific questions you'd like to ask  (8 mins)
2. Interviews with former team members (assign? Provide more than one rotation?) (5 mins each/10 total?)
	Describe a few of the strengths to each other -- have you seen me do this? What advice do you have on how I could do this more?
3. Agile Principles -- Review the manifesto and discuss how the principles describe effective teams (5-10 mins)
4. Create your own manifesto of how you want to describe your team's approach to your project; how can you create some teamwork principles that emphasize each team members' strengths? Be prepared to share with team members who are not in this session when you go back to work on the project (20 mins)

### Opening (5 mins)
In Module Two, you've had a greater focus on teamwork, and today's session is a culmination of this development. 

Review of PD deliverables for this module:

* Reflection on project management practices
* Reflection on feedback you've received and how you've acted on it.

Your work in the session today will help you with both of those deliverables as you approach them through the lens of how your strengths contribute to your abilities as a team member through personal reflections, conversations with former team members, and ideas for how to increase your team's effectiveness by capitalizing on each other's strengths

The session today will be using the second step of the StrengthsFinder curriculum -- Development & Integration through the lens of teamwork:

* Discovery/Awareness
* Development/Integration
* Application
* Relationship

### Individual Reflections (8 mins)
Reflect on your Johari Windows to reflect on how you've been interacting with partners and teams. 

**Write:** 

* How do I feel like I have used my strengths when I've paired with others?
* How could I utilize these strengths more?
* What gets in my way or keeps me from fully using my strengths?


### Pair & Share: Inquiry (10 mins; 1 min transition = 11 mins)
Pair up with a former team member. Describe a few of your strengths to each other

* Have you seen me express these strengths? If so, how?
* What advice do you have on how I could express this strength more?

### Agile Review (5 mins)
Read through the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) again. 

* How does this manifesto describe teamwork to you? 
* Is there anything missing that could describe a better approach to team projects?
* How is this manifesto relevant to the work you've been doing in Mod 2?

### Group Activity (20 mins)
As a group, you will discuss your approach to the project thus far -- how are each other's strengths being utilized? How do your strengths complement each other? 

Using the [12 principles of Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) as a model, work as a team to come up with a set of principles to emphasize each team member's strengths and how you will continue to work together. Be prepared to share this list with team members who aren't participating in StrengthsFinder.
