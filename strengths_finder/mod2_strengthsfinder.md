# Module Two StrengthsFinder: Who are you...as a Team Member?

### Objectives:

* Evaluate your behavior using strengths
* Describe in detail how you contribute to teams using your strengths
* Describe you might adapt your strengths according to team dynamics
* Discuss how to leverage each others' strengths to work even more effectively in your project

### Opening (5 mins)
In Module Two, you've had a greater focus on teamwork, and today's session is a culmination of this development. 

Review of PD deliverables for this module:

* Reflection on project management practices
* Reflection on feedback you've received and how you've acted on it.

Your work in the session today will help you with both of those deliverables as you approach them through the lens of how your strengths contribute to your abilities as a team member through personal reflections, conversations with former team members, and ideas for how to increase your team's effectiveness by capitalizing on each other's strengths

The session today will be using the second step of the StrengthsFinder curriculum -- Development & Integration through the lens of teamwork:

* Discovery/Awareness
* Development/Integration
* Application
* Relationship

### Individual Reflections (8 mins)
Reflect on your Johari Windows to reflect on how you've been interacting with partners and teams. 

**Write:** 

* How do I feel like I have used my strengths when I've paired with others?
* How could I utilize these strengths more?
* What gets in my way or keeps me from fully using my strengths?


### Pair & Share: Inquiry (10 mins; 1 min transition = 11 mins)
Pair up with a former team member. Describe a few of your strengths to each other

* Have you seen me express these strengths? If so, how?
* What advice do you have on how I could express this strength more?

### Agile Review (5 mins)
Read through the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) again. 

* How does this manifesto describe teamwork to you? 
* Is there anything missing that could describe a better approach to team projects?
* How is this manifesto relevant to the work you've been doing in Mod 2?

### Group Activity (20 mins)
As a group, you will discuss your approach to the project thus far -- how are each other's strengths being utilized? How do your strengths complement each other? 

Using the [12 principles of Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) as a model, work as a team to come up with a set of principles to leverage each team member's strengths and how this will positively impact your team for the rest of the project. Be prepared to share this list with team members who aren't participating in StrengthsFinder.
