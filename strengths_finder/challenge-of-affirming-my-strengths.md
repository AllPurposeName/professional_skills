###The Challenge of Affirming My Strengths


**Structure:** M1 small groups

**Follow-Up to:** Initial discussion of SF results during 1-on-1s

**Time in Module:** Week 5 or 6

**Time:** 40 mins.

**Size:** Groups of 4-6

Find the worksheets for the session [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1st3WH7cqXZqiXqYwYqiGbXrYf4st0hdeHvBwVIOD6SQ/edit?usp=sharing). Make your own copy by going to File>Make a copy. Title that copy "Your Name, Cohort: Challenge of Affirming My Strengths"

**Objectives:**

* Identify the difficulties associated with affirming one’s own strengths.

* Identify how to utilize one signature strength through an actionable short-term plan for the next module at Turing.

**Deliverables (as google docs or gists):**

* Statements on how to overcome challenges for each strength
* Goals for next module on how to use strengths

**Overview:**

Talking about and acknowledging our strengths can be challenging. These challenges require intentional thought and action to overcome. Otherwise, we can end up focusing on our weaknesses rather than building our natural strengths. This activity will focus on identifying a challenge that stems from a particular trait and describing the situation that you’ve experienced. Use the examples to get an idea.

**Opening:**

Do you ever question your strengths? What makes it hard for you to affirm your strengths? List whatever comes to mind.

How can we overcome these challenges?

**Group Discussion:**

Example Difficulty #1: “I was blind to my strengths.”

* How could this be true for us? What does it look like to be blind to our strengths?

Example Strength: Adaptability

* What does it mean to be adaptable?

How could one be blind to how Adaptability is a strength?

* Example Affirmation: “I have always been adaptable and never considered it to be special. I took for granted my ability to move from one task to another with ease, but now I see how it really benefits me to be able to multi-task and change topics quickly in this environment.”


Example Difficulty #2: “I’m afraid my strengths could hinder me.”

* How might we sometimes think our strengths could hold us back?

Example Strength: Strategic

* What does it mean to be Strategic?

How can I affirm this strength instead of seeing it as a hindrance?

* Example Affirmation: “I have always been very contemplative, and this strength points to the fact that I like to process information to come up with a solution. This seems like it could be a detriment in a fast-paced environment like Turing, but I’ve realized that my data-driven approach to collecting student and staff experience information adds a thoroughness to my work that is important in our growing program.”


**Partner Activity/Group Activity:**

You are grouped according to a shared strength with the rest of the small group. Discuss as partners and/or whole group how one of the challenges might apply to that strength (or come up with one on your own) and how you will reaffirm it. Use the worksheet linked above.


**Independent Activity:**
Fill out the rest of the worksheet with your responses to the following challenges:

* Challenge: “My strengths threaten others.”
* Challenge: “In the past, I’ve been in a position or role that didn’t fit my strengths.”
* Challenge: “I’m afraid of being seen as proud or arrogant.”
* Challenge: “I don’t see how my strengths could help me reach my goals.”
* Challenge: “I have trouble seeing these strengths in the day-to-day.”
* Come up with your own challenges if these don't feel relevant to you.
* Decide on how you will use your strengths next module.

**Debrief:**

* How was this experience for you? Do you feel like you have a more clear picture of how to use your strengths? What could make this more clear?
* Do our strengths need further development in order to overcome these challenges?
* What role does this strength play in your life? Both at Turing and outside of Turing.
* What action steps will you each take to utilize this strength more during the rest of this module? How will this strength help you in module 2?
* How can you support each other with these action steps?
