# Module Two StrengthsFinder: Who are you...as a Team Member?

### Objectives:

* Describe in detail how you contribute to teams using your strengths
* Describe you might adapt your strengths according to team dynamics
* Develop user stories to build empathy for teammates and describe team effectiveness
* Discuss how to leverage others' strengths to work better in teams

Edits:
-Coaching session: G.O.O.D.
-Use all 5 strengths; 
-Individual reflection first: read through action items (I could maybe pull together their action items ahead of time); reflect on 
-Gallery walk -- people fill out 
-In rotating partners, they describe themselves and describe how they are effective team members; they have to then discuss how they would work together as a 
-Look over Johari Windows -- how have you already been using your strengths? In what areas, could you develop your strengths more?
-Students should give feedback/insight on how each other are using their strengths...could pair up according to teams they've worked in?

### Opening
As you learned in Personal Branding I in Module One, there are 3 questions that drive your professional development at Turing:

* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

Reflecting on last module, use your strengths to answer the question “Who are you?” in high-level 1-2 sentences to share with the group.

Today, we'll build on that sentence(s) by working to answer the question, "who are you...as a team member?"

### Group Dynamics & Change
In agile teams, status is a driving factor -- both leaders and followers are essential to the team in different ways. The [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) states:

	Build projects around motivated individuals. 
	Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 

Within your teams, you need to be prepared to adjust your status level in order to enable the team to be successful. As discussed in the book [Improv-ing Agile Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Improv-ing-Agile-Teams-Constraints-Creativity/dp/0993301304), improvisational techniques provide us with some lessons on how to do this.

In improv, communication revolves around "offers" and "blocks" -- offers are positive suggestions intended to move a team forward while blocks require all parties to move in alternate directions.

For example, this conversation is had between a Product Owner and a Project Manager:

	Product Owner: I need these extra features to be included in this sprint. 
	One of our major customers is depending on it.

	Project Manager: Of course. We'll see what we can do.

Replaying the scenario, the Project Manager uses a **block** to match status with the Product Owner:

	Product Owner: I need these extra features to be included in this sprint. 
	One of our major customers is depending on it. (Offer)

	Project Manager: That's a risk. We stand to reduce the quality of the features 
	in progress if we accept a change right now. (Block)

The Project Manager matches status by exhibiting knowledge and experience and providing information that the Product Owner might not be aware of. To make progress, someone's status needs to change ever so slightly -- 

	Product Owner: Good point. When is a better time to bring 
	this to the team's attention? (Alternate offer)

	Project Manager: We have a team meeting later today to discuss the rest of our task list. 
	If you can attend, that will give you an idea of the effort required by the team. 
	You should be able to set expectations with the client from there. (Offer)

**Discussion Question #1:**

* What do you notice about the idea of status in this scenario?
* How might this scenario look in a Turing project group?  

**Discussion Question #2:** 
Discuss how your shared strength can help you create offers or blocks depending on your status within the group:

* As a project manager, what would this look like?
* As a supporting team member, what would this look like?

### Group Discussion & Brainstorming

Within your small group, pick both a scribe and a timekeeper. You will have 20 minutes to discuss both your shared and differing strengths in the context of teams:

1. How does your shared strength make you an effective team member? 
2. In what team situations would you want to dial this strength back? How can you do that?
2. As you discuss differing strengths within your small group -- how can these strengths complement each other? When might they be at conflict? 
3. If no differing strengths within the group, what kind of person's strengths might complement your strength? When might they be at conflict? You can reference the [list of all StrengthsFinder strengths](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/BriefDescriptionsOfThemes.pdf). 
3. Storytelling I: Creating User Stories for the perfect team. Your goal here is to create user stories to describe ideal situations for both yourself and different team members and by doing so, you gain a perspective of how others in your team relate to one another.
	* Use this template for your user stories: 
	

As...[specific team member/team member's strength]
I want...[something to happen within a team]
So that...[the team is successful in this way] 

Here are some examples:

	As a person with strength in Adaptability, I want to use my flexible nature to 
	add value to my team so that if plans go awry, I can adjust to new circumstances 
	and help our team make progress. 
	
	As I work with someone who is strong in the Futuristic strength, I want to remember 
	that they are focused on the future and will ask them for their longterm vision for 
	the project so that I can help ensure that project goals incorporate that vision.
