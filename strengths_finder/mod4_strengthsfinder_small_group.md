# Module 4 StrengthsFinder: What's next?

### Objectives

* Reflect on how your strengths have helped you throughout your time at Turing
* Create a vision statement for your future career
* Articulate your vision as practice in telling your story
* Devise an action step to help you begin to realize your vision

### Opening Reflection (10 minutes)
Review what this strength means and write about one way this strength has helped you during the previous 3 modules. Each person shares out, and the whole group will provide another example of how they've seen each person use that strength. 

### Envisioning the Future (12 minutes)
In the Flower Exercise, you were asked to reflect on your past in order to influence what kind of future you will pursue. Today, you'll work on crafting your vision statement for that future. This is another kind of storytelling.

**1. Start with Your Ending** 

Reflect on another [narrative rule described by Emma Coats, the former Pixar story artist](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar):

	Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. 
	Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
	
Imagine that it's one year from now - what have you accomplished during that time? How is your life different? How have your strengths influenced that change?

Use this imagined year ahead when developing your vision statement in the next step. 

**2. Create a vision statement to answer the question, "What's next?"**

Guidelines for writing your vision statement:

* Make your statements stretching, challenging, and interrupting of the status quo.
* Write in the future tense (I will...)
* Is the statement grounded -- have you been able to demonstrate something similar using your strengths in the past?
* Use your strengths -- you can think about just one or all 5 of your top strengths as a starting point

Examples:

"In the next year, I will be a testament to my strength as a Learner as I continuously pursue my passions. I will build software that represents my Futuristic strength by looking ahead at what's to come and anticipating problems that need to be solved in society."

"In the next year, I will create a culture shift in the software industry by pursuing work that focuses on social justice issues. By using both my strengths in Individualization and Woo, I will address a wide spectrum of users' needs and challenge what is already in place while attracting like-minded clients." 

"In the next year, I will pursue my dream of living abroad by targeting companies where remote work is supported, using my Achiever strength to drive me and my Analytical strength to turn 'wishful thinking' into reality."

### Pair & Share (12 minutes)
Pair up with someone else from the group and share your vision statement. You partner will give you feedback:

* Is the vision statement clear? 
* What is powerful about that vision?
* How do your partner's strengths support their vision?
* What practical advice do you have for how your partner could start turning that vision statement into reality?

### Final Reflection & Whole Group Share-out (10 minutes)
Take 5 minutes to reflect on your partner's feedback and make adjustments and/or additions to your vision statement. Then, brainstorm one action step you'll take by the end of the module to start realizing your vision, how you will do it, and how others can support you.  

Consider:

* How can you communicate your strengths and vision through your Turing website profile or your LinkedIn profile? 
* How will you explore a new language or technology you're interested in?
* How will you utilize networking opportunities to connect with people who can help you realize your vision?
* How would you like support from your cohortmates?

Share out your action steps with the group. We can help hold each other accountable to our visions.
