# Module 4 StrengthsFinder: What's next?


### Envisioning the Future 
In the Flower Exercise, you're being asked to reflect on your past in order to influence what kind of future you will pursue. Today, you'll work on crafting your vision statement for that future. This is another kind of storytelling.

**1. Start with Your Ending** 

Reflect on one more narrative rule that Coats describes:

	Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. 
	Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
	
Imagine that it's one year from now - what have you accomplished during that time? How is your life different? How have your strengths influenced that change?

Use this imagined year ahead to develop your vision statement.

**2. Create a vision statement to answer the question, "Why are you here?"**

Guidelines for writing your vision statement:

* Make your statements stretching, challenging, and interrupting of the status quo.
* Write in present tense (I am here to...)
* Is the statement grounded -- have you been able to demonstrate something similar using your strengths in the past?

Examples:

"I am here because I have a dream to start my own business, using my Achiever strength to drive me and my Analytical strength to turn 'wishful thinking' into reality."

"I am here as a testament to my strength as a Learner -- to continuously pursue my passions. I build software that represents my Futuristic strength by looking ahead at what's to come and anticipating problems that need to be solved in society."

"I am here to create a culture shift in the software industry so that software more fully represents the people who use it. By using both my strengths in Individualization and Woo, I address a wide spectrum of users' needs and challenge what is already in place while attracting clients to my way of thinking."
