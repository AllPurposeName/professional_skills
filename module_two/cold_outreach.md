## Learning Competencies

- Connect with other developers to learn more about the industry and opportunities
- Learn how to navigate applying based on internal expectations/directions
- Build network for sustainable, long-term career opportunities

## Summary

As we mentioned in [Finding Opportunities](finding_opportunities.md), looking for jobs on sites like monster.com, Indeed, and other career listing sites can be discouraging and ineffective. Now that you've done the research an added companies to your job tracker with a point of contact at each, let's learn how to learn about opportunities within those companies or companies similar.

- Check out the [Cold Outreach](../files/cold_outreach_meg.key) slide deck for more research support.

## Objectives

- Focus on building relationships with companies through fellow developers
- Ask for an informational interview

## Cold Outreach Format

- Keep it short (5 - 7 sentences)
- Be direct with your ask, can they respond with one sentence?
- Casual introduction, no "to whom this may concern"
- Don't tell your story. Short, sweet, concise.

### Your Turn

- Pick one contact from your job tracker board.
- Craft a short, concise, and direct email to that contact asking for an informational interview.
- Build rapport either through a personal or professional common interest.
- End the email with a direct ask for a specific time to grab coffee/hop on a call.
