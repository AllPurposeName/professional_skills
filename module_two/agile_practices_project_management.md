# Agile Practices & Project Management 

[Slides for this lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/agile_practices_slides.pdf)

### Objectives
* Demonstrate an understanding of different agile practices
* Describe how to use these agile practices with your teams
* Utilize strategies for building trust in teams

**Portfolio Deliverables:**

Paragraph reflection in your portfolio on:

* Details on project management strategies you used in your projects; What went well? What didnâ€™t go well?

### Opening Reflection
Write:

* What has made your previous teams successful? What has made them difficult?
* When working together for the first time, what can you do/have you done to make sure your team is productive?

### What is Agile?
Agile is both a series of processes and a philosophy around how to develop software in a more efficient way.

And to explain it, let's start with what it's not. Agile is a response to the Waterfall method.

The [Waterfall model](http://www.agilenutshell.com/agile_vs_waterfall) is a sequential (non-iterative) design process in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance. Each phase is treated as a one-off activity and does not react well to change -- *Do you need to adjust something after you've already gone to the next phase? Too late.* 

Needless to say, waterfall became an ineffective way to run software development. So, seventeen software developers came together and created the Agile Manifesto.

Read through the 12 principles of the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). 

* What do you notice about these principles? Do any particularly resonate with you?
* How might these principles be applied? How have you already seen them in action at Turing?

### Exploring Agile Practices
Based on these principles, processes have been created for teams to embrace agile methodology:

* Scrum:

* Tuckman's Stages of Team Development:

	* [More Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development)
* [XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)

Within your small groups, discuss your assigned process and then present to the whole group:

* Summarize how this process works -- what do you see as pros and cons?
* How would this process look at Turing?
* Think back to the successful teams you wrote about in your warmup questions. What did you do to get you through the early stages to become successful?

### Project Management Tools
There are also lots of project management tools available to reinforce these processes:

* [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/)
* Git Workflow for Teams ***ADD IN RESOURCES FROM BACKEND'S LESSON***
* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [CA Technologies](https://www.ca.com/us/why-ca/about-us/acquisitions/rally-is-now-ca-technologies.html?cid=GLOB-EOA-ABUS-ADB-000083-00000151)


### How to Create Successful Teams
In order for teams to be successful, they need to build trust with each other. How do you do that? The first step is communication.

### Reflections & Applications
As your prepare for your next team project DTR, consider:

* How will agile practices help you manage a larger team than you're used to working in?
* What project management tool will you use to plan out a project that has some ambiguity?
* Your group should choose someone to be the project manager. What responsibilities will that individual have?
