# Agile Practices & Project Management 

[Slides for this lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/agile_practices_slides.pdf)

### Objectives
* Demonstrate an understanding of different agile practices
* Describe how to use these agile practices with your teams
* Utilize strategies for building trust in teams

**Portfolio Deliverables:**

Paragraph reflection in your portfolio on:

* Details on project management strategies you used in your projects; What went well? What didnâ€™t go well?

### Warm Up Reflection
Write:

* What has made your previous teams successful? What has made them difficult?
* When working together for the first time, what can you do/have you done to make sure your team is productive?

### What is Agile?
Agile is both a series of processes and a philosophy around how to develop software in a more efficient way.

And to explain it, let's start with what it's not. Agile is a response to the Waterfall method.

The [Waterfall model](http://www.agilenutshell.com/agile_vs_waterfall) is a sequential (non-iterative) design process in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance. Each phase is treated as a one-off activity and does not react well to change -- *Do you need to adjust something after you've already gone to the next phase? Too late.* 

Needless to say, waterfall became an ineffective way to run software development. So, seventeen software developers came together and created the Agile Manifesto.

Read through the 12 principles of the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). 

* What do you notice about these principles? Do any particularly resonate with you?
* How might these principles be applied? 

### Exploring Agile Practices
Based on these principles, processes have been created for teams to embrace agile methodology:

* Scrum:

	* [More Info](https://www.scrum.org/Resources/What-is-Scrum) 	
* Tuckman's Stages of Team Development:
	* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhSI6oBQmQA&list=PLbu6naAjG_K93h0wjyn1b1EHQl1Q2pH_y)
	* [More Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development)
* [XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)

Within your small groups, discuss your assigned process:

* Summarize how this process works -- what do you see as pros and cons?
* Think back to the successful teams you wrote about in your warmup questions. How have you already utilized this process? How would this process have helped your team?  
* How can you utilize this process at Turing?

Groups present on the process that they discussed to the whole group. 

### Project Management Tools
Think about how to reinforce these processes:

* [Git Workflow for Teams](https://docs.google.com/a/casimircreative.com/spreadsheets/d/11JEKXiW7Pp7XZct191mmJv45XDwq1w6nfWNNKAbD36U/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/) 
	* Convert the requirements of the project to stories/issues on Waffle (e.g. Average GPA - average_gpa returns the average GPA for all students)
	* Let the stories drive development, even copy and paste the story into the tests
	* Use waffle to track tasks to be completed
	* Use waffle to keep you focused (i.e. avoid rabbit holes)
* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [CA Technologies](https://www.ca.com/us/why-ca/about-us/acquisitions/rally-is-now-ca-technologies.html?cid=GLOB-EOA-ABUS-ADB-000083-00000151)

### Show What You Know: Creating Successful Teams
In order for teams to be successful, they need to establish trust. We'll do that today by creating a set of norms for our teams at Turing to follow. 

Go back to the Agile Manifesto to create your own set of principles for how to use agile at Turing. Each group takes on a line from the Manifesto to establish 1-2 principles for how that will look at Turing, and as a class, a set of Turing principles will be established: 

	We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
	Through this work we have come to value:

	**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
	**Working software** over comprehensive documentation
	**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
	**Responding to change** over following a plan

	That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Reflections & Applications
As your prepare for your next team project DTR, consider:

* How will agile practices help you manage a larger team than you're used to working in?
* What project management tool will you use to plan out a project that has some ambiguity?
* Your group should choose someone to be the project manager. What responsibilities will that individual have?
