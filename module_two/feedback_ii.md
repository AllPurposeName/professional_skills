# Feedback II

[Slides for this lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/feedback_ii_slides.pdf)

###Objectives

* Identify when triggers are at play in feedback
* Use the Johari Window technique to recognize your own blind spots
* Use the right-wrong spotting techniques to break down feedback you've received
* Create an action plan for how to improve your practices from feedback you've received

**Portfolio Deliverables:**

2-paragraph reflection in your portfolio on:

* How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process

###Opening

**Revisit the three triggers to feedback:**

* Truth
* Relationship
* Identity

**Read over this scenario and think about what triggers this might bring up for you if you were in this situation:**

"You need to work on your communication skills. You made big functionality decisions without discussing them with the other members of our team. Not only that, but other members of the group had to rewrite tests for the functionality that you worked on. If you had checked in with us, the project could have been more of a team effort."

**Pair & Share with a partner:** 

* If you received this feedback, what triggers might come up for you and why?

**Now let's see a little more of the picture:**

The receiver of this feedback experienced a truth trigger when they read this -- *What is this person talking about? I'm a great communicator! I told them everything I was doing! Why didn't they tell me when the tests weren't passing?* 

So, the receiver asked for more clarification around the feedback, and the giver replied, "You missed several of our group pairing sessions and didn't tell us you wouldn't be there. Whenever I reached out to you on Slack, you either didn't reply or sent me short messages saying that you had already finished the tasks. It made for a really tense relationship, and I didn't think you were going to listen if I told you that we needed help with the testing. It seemed like you didn't care about the rest of the team."    

What about the person's behavior might have contributed to the feedback that they received?

###Blind Spots 
A blind spot is something you don’t see about yourself that others do see.  Language that you use, facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and behavioral patterns show your blind spots, and they impede true communication.

Increasing awareness of your blind spots is an important first step, and you can do that by analyzing patterns in your behavior. When you receive feedback, consider:

* Where have I heard this feedback before? 
* When do I feel like I’ve gotten in my own way? 

What blind spots might be at play in these scenarios?

**Scenario #1:** You receive this Slack message from your partner: "I know I said I'd have all the tests done by the end of today, but I forgot that it's my dog's birthday and that really takes priority, so I'm not going to be able to get that stuff done. Hope that's cool!"

**Scenario #2:** During DTR, Teammate A is very enthusiastic about the project, talking about their own ideas at length. Teammate B and C sit quietly and don't say much. Teammate A says, "Well, since you two don't have much to say, I'll go ahead and be the project manager." Teammate B rolls their eyes, and Teammate C says that sounds fine.  

**Scenario #3:** You feel great about how pairing went last week with a Mod. 1 student. During the pairing session, you helped drive and explained everything you were doing. You talked through the entire problem, and the student didn’t seem to have any questions. But the next week, that student doesn't want to meet with you. You DM the student to ask if they want to meet again, but the student makes a few comments that a lot of the material was “was over my head” and “hard to understand.” They say they're going to pair with someone else this week who might be able to "reach me on my level."

###Right & Wrong Spotting
When we receive feedback, often our first reaction is that it's wrong. That's a valid feeling -- go with it. List everything that seems wrong about the feedback.

And then go back through the feedback and pull out what might be *right* about it -- what truth is there in this feedback? What is something that you can easily implement? 

Allison will model this using feedback she's received.

###Independent Reflections
**Activity #1:** Complete the [Johari Window activity](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md) using the adjectives you and your teammates identified for you ahead of time. 

Analyze:

* What do you notice about each quadrant? 
* For the Blind Spot quadrant, is there anything you'd like to build more awareness around? How will you do that? 

**Activity #2:** Analyze feedback you've received from your most recent group project. Use the right & wrong spotting technique to recognize your feelings about the feedback and what could be done with it. 

As you're writing in the wrong column, think about:

* What behavior did my partners see? Are there any blind spots I might have? 

In the right column, make plans for how you can improve in the next team or pair project. Think about:

* What is useful here?
* What is something I want to work on from this feedback?


### Closing

Share out -- what feedback will you incorporate into your next team project?
