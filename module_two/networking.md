# Networking

Reference [Networking slide deck](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/networking.pdf) for a refresher

## Learning Competencies:

- Establish rapport with local tech community
- Demonstrate relationship building skills

## Tell Your Story
We talk about the importance of telling your story for your personal brand collateral (resume, LinkedIn, personal website, etc.), but how does that translate when you meet new people? Do you know how to verbally tell your story in a clear and concise way? How do you answer the broad request, "tell me about yourself"?

### Your Turn
- Bullet point the answers to the questions:
	- Who are you? As a developer, teammate, career changer, individual
	- How did you get here? Why software development? Why Turing School? Why now?
	- Whatâ€™s next? What will you be working on after Turing School? Is there a particular industry/tech stack/project you would like to be working with?
	
- Practice talking about your experience, new technical skills, and how you'd like to give back to the tech industry with peers; solicit feedback
- Research meetups and other tech events/hackathons/workshops to participate in or join to meet other developers in the local market

## Informational Interviews = Networking
Asking for time to learn more about a company or individual is a form of networking and can prove to be more lucrative depending on what environments you're most comfortable in. If you do better in one-on-one conversations, focus on this type of networking rather than putting all of your energy into large events/groups.

### Your Turn
- Choose one of the companies from your list that was generated during the Finding Opportunities workshop
- Use LinkedIn to find someone at that company you believe you could build a connection with. Note that this does not need to be the recruiter or hiring manager, this could be (and probably should be) a developer at any level.
- Look for their email using [Rapportive](https://rapportive.com/), [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/), or clone a repo from their GitHub to pull the email.
- Craft an email that draws a personalized connection between you and the person you're email. Make it clear that it's not a form letter that could be sent to anyone.
- Keep it concise and to the point.
- Wrap up the email with a call to action. i.e. "Are you available to grab coffee on X day at X time at X place (pick somewhere close to their office)?"
- Follow up to that thread if you haven't heard back in 3-5 days.

## Warm Introductions
Having someone you know introduce you to a developer or hiring manager can be very helpful in getting the conversation started with a company of interest. Take a look at mutual connections on LinkedIn to determine who would be best at providing an introduction. Always ask for an introduction to the right person rather than "pass your resume along." This will help you maintain the control of your job search rather than leaving it up to someone else.

### Your Turn
- Find someone you'd like to connect with
- Who are your mutual connections
- Request an introduction from your mutual connection by sending the person you would like to connect with's name, email address, LinkedIn profile, and context for wanting an introduction
- When email introduction is sent, do not wait for the other person to respond, respond immediately
- Email response should follow similar format:
	- "Thank you [person who into'd you] for the introduction. Moving you to bcc. Hi [person being intro'd to], it's great to meet you. [email content giving more context] Are you available to grab coffee [a call if not local] on X date at X time?"
	- Always move the introducer to bcc upon introduction
	- Always have a call to action
	- Do not ask for a job in the email, ask for advice always
	- Never tell your whole story in an email, if it's too long you risk the person on the other end not responding.
- Follow up if you don't hear back in 3 - 5 days.
