#Collaborative Communication 

This session follows the BEE M2 project management lesson and precedes the Rush Hour project kickoff. 

##Pre-Reading from *How to Win Friends & Influence People in the Digital Age*: 
* [Chapter 4: Ask Questions Instead of Giving Direct Orders from How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/Chapter%204%20Ask%20Questions%20Instead%20of%20Giving%20Direct%20Orders.pdf)
* [Chapter 5: Mitigate Fault from How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/Chapter%205%20Mitigate%20Fault.pdf)

##Learning Objectives:
* Describe how to use agile practices with teams
* Describe how you can use your strengths and leadership skills to be an effective team member
* Describe and utilize strategies for communicating with team members when mistakes/failures happen

##Connections:
* Success in M2: M2 is where you hone your teamwork skills. Understanding and using project management best practices is essential to becoming an effective team member. 
* Success in career: Your technical skills will help you get a job. Your project management and communication skills will help you keep a job. Demonstrating that you can successfully work with teams and learn from mistakes in a productive way will be a huge asset to any organization

##Session Follow-Up:
Allison will meet with small groups during Week 4 to discuss and analyze feedback from Rush Hour in a productive way and prepare for success in Little Shop

##Deliverable: 
2-paragraph reflection in your portfolio on:

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects (Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process

##Discussion #1

* Debrief Chapter 4
	* What was this chapter about?
	* Do you agree with this approach? Why/why not? 
	* What does it mean to be a good leader?
	* How can you replicate this approach within teams, especially when there’s a project manager?
* Goal-Planning within Rush Hour groups:
	* What are the responsibilities of a project manager? How will the project manager support everyone? How will you work together as a group to support the project manager?
	* SCENARIO: Your group discussed skill levels and expectations in your DTR, and during the first iteration of Rush Hour, Teammate A drives while Teammate B navigates and (if applicable) Teammate C looks up documentation. Teammate A insists on going down a route he/she claims to feel comfortable with. Teammate B asks a few questions, looking confused, but then falls silent as Teammate A continues to drive and gives little explanation for what he/she is doing. Teammate C vocalizes that he/she has found a better way to complete the iteration based on some documentation, but Teammate A answers that his/her way will be better. During the group’s next check-in, Teammate A presents the code he/she produced, takes credit for it, and the other teammates sit silently. Discuss what should be done in this situation as a team. How can the project manager help to handle this? What would you do if Teammate A was your project manager?
	* How will each of you exemplify leadership within your team, whether you are the project manager or not?
	* Discuss one (or more) of the agile practices you learned about in the Project Management lesson. Which one(s) will you use in your team? What will that look like? 
##Discussion #2
* Debrief of Chapter 5:
	* What was this chapter about?
	* What does it look like to actually learn from and move past mistakes?
	* Why did I have you read this?
* Fear-Planning within Rush Hour groups:
	* SCENARIO: During your DTR for your project, Teammate A expresses that he/she wants to take on some new features that he/she has never done before. Teammates B and (if applicable) C aren’t sure about this. There is so much to get done, they want to just stick to what they know how to do well. What system can your team create to allow team members to take risks and try out new things in the project? What will your team do if Teammate A “fails”? How will your team communicate?
	* Discuss the above scenario using the prompts below:
		* Acknowledge that failure happens. How can we do that in our team? What will that look like?
		* Encourage dialogue to foster trust. How can you establish honest communication within your team?
		* Separate the person from the failure. How can you create a sense of safety in your team? How will you mitigate fault?
		* Learn from your mistakes. How can you turn a mistake into an opportunity?
		* Create a risk-taking and failure system. How can you make your team a safe place to take risks?

##Individual Reflections
Answer these questions in your journal:

* How will you use your strengths in your Rush Hour team?
* Continue fear-planning by creating individual goals for yourself:
	* How can you help the team learn from and move past mistakes?
	* What efforts can you personally take to ensure you don’t blame others for “failures”? What could you do instead?
