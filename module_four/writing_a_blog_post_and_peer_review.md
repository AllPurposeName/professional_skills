#Scale Up: Writing a Blog Post & Peer Review

[Slides for this lesson](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BtFtpS_OWhQp9AJbXc9woI5ql8sD-etxwnFc-4rixEI/edit?usp=sharing)


###Objectives:
* Decide on a structure for your Scale Up blog post
* Identify effective techniques from a tech blog post
* Gather feedback for how to make your blog post clear
* Utilize tools for revising your blog post


###Deliverable:
Blog post on the features you choose to implement or research in Scale Up

###Opening:
One of your requirements for the Scale Up project is to write a blog post. The blog post is actually a very important part of your Scale Up project because this is the place where you express all the things you’ve learned to people who don’t know you but should. *People who should know what kickass developers you’ve become.* *People who should hire you.* 

Why are you writing this?

* To educate -- why? Because programmers learn from other programmers.

* To show yourself off -- why? Because, again, you’re a kickass developer and the world deserves to know it. And, you’re looking for a job. This is great since many people want to hire kickass developers

Write for non-developers:
Strike a balance between talking like an industry insider and explaining your concepts in very simple language. 

###Template It Out: Decide What Your Post Is
Start with a template to help define your intent in writing *(adapted from emptysqua.re/blog post “Resources for Writing About Programming” by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis)*

**Story:** 

"I'm going to tell you a story about [blank], how it taught me [blank], and led to [blank]. First this happened, then that happened. And that's the story of [blank]."

Examples:

* I did this project and learned this thing. I found out this thing about myself.
* I went to a conference and heard these talks. I met these certain people and learned something.
* I did this activity using this technology and here’s what happened.

Practice this: 

* Use the story template to describe how you learned to ride a bike.


**Opinion:** 

Structure:

1. Thesis 
2. Evidence to support Thesis 
3. Response to likely objections
4. Restate Thesis

Focus on not only having an opinion but also crafting a compelling argument to support it.

Tip: If your thesis is “This technology/language/app is bad,” describe your experience with it and concrete evidence about *why* it’s bad

Practice this:

How could you use the opinion template to describe your favorite holiday? Why is it the best holiday to you? What evidence do you have to back that up?


**How-To:**

How-Tos must be motivated by something. Begin by telling your reader when and why this how-to is important to know.

“Doing [blank] is important under the given conditions: [blank]. I’m going to show you how to [blank]. Do this, then do that. There, now I’ve shown you how to [blank]. You should go out and do [blank].”

Hint: Any time you solve a problem, write about how you did it!

Practice this: 

How could you use the how-to template to walk through how to make coffee? 


**How Something Works:**
There doesn’t need to be a clear motivation here other than what are you interested in learning?

When you’re trying to figure out how something works for a project or just something that interests you, writing an explanation of how it works is a good excuse to dive in and find out more.

“Do you wonder how [blank] works? I’m going to show you how [blank] is implemented. It does this and that. Now I’ve shown you how it works.”

Practice this:

How could you use this to describe how a typewriter works? 

**Review:**

Use reviews to describe and analyze instead of evaluating. It’s tempting to evaluate books/movies/games/projects on a good-bad axis, but this isn’t very useful. What is this thing *good for?*

“I read, saw, played, or used [blank]. This is what it is. This is what my experience was like. [Blank] has these strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion, it’s best when using these certain criteria to evaluate it.”

Practice this: 

Write a review of a game that inspired your game time project. What are some pros and cons of how that game is built and its user experience? Under what conditions are you evaluating it?


Now that you have a template, let’s talk about language


###Seeing this in the real world
Check out posts from any of these blogs:

* [Google Developers Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/)
* [Code as Craft - Etsy's Engineering Blog](https://codeascraft.com/)
* [Netflix Tech Blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/)
* [Tesla Blog](https://www.tesla.com/blog)
* [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)
* [Code Simplicity](http://www.codesimplicity.com/)
* [Christos Pontikis](http://www.pontikis.net/)
* [Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/)
* [David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/)
* [Andy Hunt](http://andy.pragprog.com/)

Think about:

* What are your takeaways?
* Was anything unclear? If so, what?
* What did you learn?
* How would you describe the writing in this post? 
* What can you apply to your own post? 


###Free Write
Decide on a structure for your blog post and think about your audience. Start on a draft based on what you’ve done so far in your project


###Kill Your Darlings -- Peer Review 
Kill Your Darlings refers to a revision technique -- *you need to be willing to let go of some of your favorite ideas if they don’t work for the overall message.*

**Pair up:** 

Share what you’re doing in your project by explaining it to a classmate in your own words, your own voice
Your partner should think about:

* What questions do you have? 
* What do you still want to know? 
* What should be added to this post?

Take notes!

As you work on your post and complete revisions, here are some tools:

* [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) -- Analyzes your sentence structures for readability and improvements
* [Wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/) -- In addition to counting your words, it also calculates reading time

**Peer Review Process:**

* [Start draft on Medium](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874698-Drafts)
* [Share with partners](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/215564177-Share-a-draft)
* [Notes section](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214035868)
* Treat the revision process like the code review process -- utilize systems (pull requests) to communicate with your peers and improve your post before finalizing the draft!
