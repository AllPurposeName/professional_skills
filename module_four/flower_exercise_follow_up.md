# Flower Exercise Follow-Up: Overcoming Job Searching Impostor's Syndrome

[Slides for this lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/m4_flower_exercise_follow_up.pdf)

### Objectives

* Identify your top 3 priorities in your first dev job
* Identify areas where you might place barriers on yourself in terms of the job search
* Devise an action plan to overcome those barriers
* Create a job search support group within your cohort -- you are each other’s best support system and allies in this search

### Deliverables

* Utilize the plans you create today when you fill out The Plan for your portfolio

### Opening
Today, we'll discuss strategies for handling anxieties of the job search. You have many resources available to you during your job search, including meeting with Meg (your Employment Coordinator) and your Turing community at large.

But how can you help yourself during this time? How can you help yourself overcome anxieties that hold you back in the job search? We'll approach these anxieties from the standpoint of coaching, and you'll walk away from today's session with actionable steps to implement to overcome any barriers. 

### (Perceived) Barriers to your Job Search
We can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities because we don’t think we deserve them, and we create our own barriers to success.

* Examples of barriers:
	* "I just want a job." When you don't clarify what you want, it can cause your job search to meander, and this could be a barrier for what you really want. 
	* "I talk myself out of applying to certain jobs because I don’t meet enough of the listed qualifications."
*This is common among women.*
	* "I don’t feel comfortable networking. It feels forced, and I don’t want to do something that doesn’t feel genuine, so I stay home from meet-ups."
	* "Interviews make me really nervous, so I end up performing badly. It’s hard for me to code or communicate on the spot."

What are some barriers you might carry with you? Think about these areas:

* Entering the Software Industry
* Cold Outreach
* Networking
* Interviewing (either technical or culture fit)
* Personal Branding for yourself
* Other -- what other anxieties do you have that aren't covered in the other categories? 

**Activity:** 
Go around the classroom writing up any anxieties you have for each of the above categories. 

**Debrief Flower Exercise:** Write, Pair, Share
While Allison compiles answers from the chart papers, students reflect on their Flower Exercise:

Written reflection:

* What are you looking for in your first dev job? Using your Flower Exercise, list the top 3 things that stand out to you as priorities in your next job. 

Pair up with someone else and discuss these 3 priorities and how you discovered them. Your partner will be listening for specifics on what you're looking for.

* Examples:
	* What kind of culture is important to your partner?
	* What does mentoring mean to them?
	* Why are these things important to the other person -- what in their past experience led to this conclusion?
	* What is something you and your partner learned about yourselves from completing the Flower Exercise?

Share out some takeaways from what you heard from your partner. This will build accountability for both you and your partner. 

Now that you have a more clear picture of what you want in your job search, we will problem solve around the barriers that may get in the way. 

### Taking Action
How do we overcome those barriers? We need to utilize coaching techniques to talk through the potential action steps we can pursue and support we can seek to move past these barriers. 

**I Do:**
Allison will demonstrate how to coach through an anxiety. 

Start with understanding what it is that holds you back in this area:
* Example: ....

Start by creating a goal:

* When you decide on an area that you'd like to improve, outline what your goal is around that improvement -- how will you know what you've overcome that barrier? What metrics will you use? 

**We Do:**
From the barriers selected, pick a small group to work with to brainstorm ideas on how to turn a barrier into something actionable and positive. You'll have 20 minutes to discuss. Be prepared to share one action step with the whole group when time is up. 

*Differentiation:*
For students who don't identify with having anxieties around these areas or already have a job, they will join a group that they feel comfortable with or have some expertise to share from their own experience to lend some coaching.

**You Do:**
Using barriers you’ve identified for yourself, expand on the action plan you started in your small groups to outline specific steps you will take to overcome those barriers



### Next Steps: Create a Job Search Support System
In your cohort, you are each other’s best resources in the job search.
What does it mean to support each other in the job search?
What can this look like?

* Communication: Create a separate channel with regular stand-ups and retros
	* Check out #1511-job-hunt, #1603-job-hunt, #1605-job-hunt, etc.
* Code review: Submit PRs and review each other’s code to help polish each other’s projects
* Pass along job leads
* Go through technical interview prep questions with each other

### Debrief
- What is a takeaway for you from this session?
- What concerns do you still have?
