# Flower Exercise Follow-Up: Overcoming Job Searching Impostor's Syndrome

[Slides for this lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/m4_flower_exercise_follow_up.pdf)

Priorities:
-Differentiation: students can self-select into groups depending on their stress levels; if students don't feel anxiety about any of the laid out ideas (or they already have a job), they will assist with the other student groups
1. Pull out Flower Exercise -- study it and reflect for 5-10 mins. on top priorities and HOW to tackle them; Share those with a partner to discuss 3 things they want to make sure they emphasize in their job search and h
2. On chart paper around the room, students write down their anxieties:
	-Entering the industry
	-Cold outreach
	-Networking
	-Branding
	-Interviews (both technical and culture fit)
	-Other (students can write down anything that didn't fit into the above)
	
-Opening -- objectives, expectations, intro the activity and the idea of "barriers"
-Students go around and fill out their anxieties
-Then students read through flower exercise and create priorities; they meet with a partner and discuss how to make them happen; Meanwhile, I will look at the results from the gallery walk and decide on what example I will walk through and how many groups should meet separately
-Students share a few takeaways
-I model a coaching session around one anxiety, soliciting input from the students on how I would solve my problem; outline options, define obstacles, land on an action step that speaks to my comfort level
-Students then break out into groups to tackle other anxieties; I float from group to group to offer some guidance
-Come back together -- share 1 action step from each group; address any last questions

### Objectives

* Identify your top 3 priorities in your first dev job
* Identify areas where you might place barriers on yourself in terms of the job search
* Devise an action plan to overcome those barriers
* Create a job search support group within your cohort -- you are each other’s best support system and allies in this search

### Deliverables

* Utilize the plans you create today when you fill out The Plan for your portfolio

### Opening
Today we'll discuss...


### (Perceived) Barriers to your Job Search
We can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities because we don’t think we deserve them, and we create our own barriers to success.

* Examples of barriers:
	* "I talk myself out of applying to certain jobs because I don’t meet enough of the listed qualifications."
*This is common among women.*
	* "I don't know if ....
	* "I don’t feel comfortable networking. It feels forced, and I don’t want to do something that doesn’t feel genuine, so I stay home from meet-ups."
	* "Interviews make me really nervous, so I end up performing badly. It’s hard for me to code or communicate on the spot."

What are some barriers you might carry with you? Think about these areas:

* Entering the Software Industry
* Cold Outreach
* Networking
* Interviewing (either technical or culture fit)
* Personal Branding for yourself
* Other -- what other anxieties do you have that aren't covered in the other categories? 

Activity: Fill out the chart paper

Differentiation: For students who don't feel anxieties




**Debrief Flower Exercise:** Write, Pair, Share

* What are you looking for in your first dev job? Using your Flower Exercise, list the top 3 things that you’re looking for in a Google Doc or Gist.
Pair up with someone else and discuss these 3 things as well as anything else you learned about yourself from completing the Flower Exercise. Your partner is looking for specifics on what you're looking for.
* Examples:
	* What kind of culture is important to your partner?
	* What does mentoring mean to them?
	* Why are these things important to the other person -- what in their past experience led to this conclusion?
	* What is something you and your partner learned about yourselves from completing the Flower Exercise?

Now that you have a more clear picture of what you want in your job search, we will examine other forces that sometimes affect our job search.

### Taking Action
How do we overcome those barriers? Brainstorm ideas on how to turn a barrier into something actionable and positive.

**Fear-Planning:** What’s the worst that could happen based on these fears? What will you do?

**Action Steps:** What steps can you take to stop these things from happening? How can we talk ourselves back into the job search? What do you know that’s true about you? (Facts, Feedback) How do you know it? (Evidence -- look at the Flower)

* Examples:
	* Seek out mentors to do mock interviews
	* Attend Improv
	* Find one thing that you’re most comfortable with in terms of personal branding and work on that first (personal blog, Twitter, personal website, LinkedIn, etc.)
	* Ask an alum or mentor about their experience entering the industry

**Independent Activity**:
Using barriers you’ve identified for yourself, create your own action plan on steps you can take to overcome those barriers


### Job Search Support System
In your cohort, you are each other’s best resources in the job search.
What does it mean to support each other in the job search?
What can this look like?

* Communication: Create a separate channel with regular stand-ups and retros
	* Check out #1511-job-hunt, #1603-job-hunt, etc.
* Code review: Submit PRs and review each other’s code to help polish each other’s projects
* Pass along job leads
* Go through technical interview prep questions with each other

Decide what your cohort’s job search support will look like.

### Debrief
- What is a takeaway for you from this session?
- What concerns do you still have?
- How can you help each other with those concerns?
