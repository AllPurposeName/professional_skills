title:  Job Search Strategy Planning
layout: page
---

What do you want to do after you complete Turing? Have you thought about the types of things you'd like to be doing on a daily basis? Or the over arching results you'd like from your career? Are you contributing to technology that changes people's lives? Are you working on a product that impacts your learning exponentially? Are you open to traveling for consulting or do you prefer to stay put in a single location?

Reference [Job Search Strategy Planning](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/job-search-strategy-planning.pdf) for refresher


## Learning Competencies
- Planning effective job search tactics
- Assessing success of a job search
- Learn when to pivot strategies


## Focus on Priorities
Similar to apartment shopping, it's important to have a list of must-have's and nice-to-have's. Know what is a deal breaker and when you are being too picky. In the case that you do not find a position with all the items on your list, what are you willing to forego for a great first job as a developer?

Priorities could include: physical location, industry, size of company, team culture, diversity makeup, technologies, flexibility, salary amount, types of benefits, mentorship, etc. 

### Your Turn
- Sketch out a list of things you'll be looking for in a job as a software developer
- If you could only have five of those things, which five would it be?
- Move the rest of the "Nice-to-Have" list
- If you could only have one of the things in your list of five, which would it be?
- Prioritize based on how you narrowed it down and identify why they are prioritized in this order

## Scheduling
Operate your job search as if you were working full time. Build out a schedule that include time for research, cold and warm outreach, networking, and coding. This schedule will look differently when you're in Turing versus after you complete Turing.

### Your Turn
- During Turing:
	- Look at the time you have to dedicate to job searching during your time at Turing
	- Identify how many hours per week you can spend on job searching, even if it is only two hours per week
	- Block that time off on your calendar
	- Set goals for tasks to complete during that time based on weekly goals
- After Turing:
	- Build out a 40 hour week divided between research, outreach, networking, and coding. Ideally two (2) - four (4) hours per day will be dedicated to code
	- Block these times out on your calendar to keep you moving along to the next task based on the timebox you've determine is adequate
	- Assess what worked with this schedule and what didn't at the end of each week. Make adjustments as needed

## Goal Setting
Goals will help guide the scheduling and priorities. Set your long term goal first. For instance, *"accept job offer within six weeks of graduating from Turing."* From there, work backwards to identify your monthly, weekly, and daily goals. Be mindful that there may need to be some adjustments to goals as you get into the job search. That is okay and completely normal. 

### Your Turn
- When is your absolutely cut off for completing your job search?
- When would you realisitcally like to have your job search completed by?
- Based on that date, identify what needs to happen on a monthly basis to reach that date? i.e. If I want a job within six weeks after completing Turing, I would need to have at least three interviews within the first month after Turing.
- Based on the monthly goals, what would need to happen on a weekly basis to reach the monthly goals? i.e. If I want at least three interviews within the first month, I would need to have at least 12 new conversations per week.
- Based on the weekly goals, what would need to happen on a daily basis to reach the weekly goals? i.e. If I want at least 12 new conversations per week, I would need to send at least five cold/warm outreach emails per day.
- Spend thirty minutes each day and an hour each week assessing how your tasks aligned with your goals. Make adjustments as needed -- it's so important to be flexible, kind to yourself, and realistic with time.

## Scheduling

### During Turing:

	* How are you spending your time?
		* Code
		* Outreach
		* Research
		* Network
	* When do you have time to dedicate to Job search?                                      
		-evenings, weekend, morning, around project work time
	* How many hours can you afford to spend on job search?                               
		-Ideally 2 hours/wk minimum
	* Block that time off on your calendar
	* Set goals for tasks to complete during that time                                       
		-research, outreach, network
	* Allocate a timebox for each task. 
	* Manage timeboxes via calendar
	* Respect the schedule                                                               
		- Can be flexible but make sure you are making time for every task everyday. If you short a task one day, give it extra time the next.
	* Respect how you like to schedule                                              
		-When are you most/least focused? Do you like having a precise schedule or varying schedule?
	* Make weekly assessments of the schedule and what did and didn’t work and adjust as needed. 

### After Turing:
	* Design a 40 hour work week that addresses  ALL tasks 
		* Code
		* Outreach
		* Research 
		* Network

### Goal Setting
Set your long term goal first and work backwards identifying monthly, weekly and daily goals.                                                         "Accept job offer within 8 weeks of graduating from Turing." 
		1. Monthly?
			* Need at least three interviews within the first month 
		2. Weekly?
			* During Turing-need at least 2 conversations per week
			* After-Need at least 12 new conversations per week are needed
		3. Daily?
			* During-Need at least 1 cold outreach email/day
			* After-Need at least 5 cold/warm outreach emails are needed/day. 

Be flexible, kind to yourself and realistic with your time. 
If something isn’t working, try something different
