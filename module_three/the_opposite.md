*(exercise adapted from the Ignite step of the Disciplined Dreaming framework)*

The Opposite is a technique to take fresh ideas to a new level. Rather than solving the problem in front of you, what if you flipped the problem around?

For example, instead of asking "How might I develop an app that will attract women?" ask yourself "How might I create an app that women will hate?" Now you're thinking about what you *don't* want to include, which leads to a fresher perspective and will help you uncover some great new ideas.

###Breaking It Down

Zipcar is an organization that rewrote their industry by using this technique. The rental car business had been stagnant with most car rental companies indistinguishable from each other. Zipcar looked at how the typical competitors did business and instead did the opposite:

	Typical Rental Car Company:
		* Rent at airports
		* Rent by the day
		* Charge per day or week
		* Sign out car via wait at counter
		* Pick up and return at company locations

	Zipcar:
		* Rent in major cities
		* Rent by the hour
		* Charge monthly membership fee
		* Use key fob to unlock cars directly
		* Pick up and return in designated parking spaces right in cities



Zipcar studied conventional wisdom and then had the courage to do the opposite. They grew their revenue by $100 million in four years and have locations in over fifty cities and at more than a hundred college campuses. 

###Put It Into Practice
With your own project, start by making a list of ideas, processes, or traditional techniques you can oppose. For example, make a list of all the ways you are currently approaching the problem you want to solve. When you have your list, identify the exact opposite approach for each item. If the traditional model calls for a certain solution, try suggesting the polar opposite. This oppositional thining can help you generate fresh and inspiring ideas.
