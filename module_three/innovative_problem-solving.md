###Objectives (you will be able to…):

* Develop and describe a framework for building your creativity
* Decide on an idea and understand next steps for personal project/side projects
* Develop a pitch and template for your project

###Deliverable:
Your project template:

				#### [Project Title]
				#### Pitch

				1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it 
				to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

				#### Problem

				1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

				#### Solution

				1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

				#### Target Audience

				1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

				#### Integrations (Back End Only)

				* Which APIs will you use?
				* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?

###Opening
Why Creativity? What is the [Disciplined Dreaming](https://www.amazon.com/Disciplined-Dreaming-Proven-Breakthrough-Creativity/dp/1611203074) Framework? 

Within the Disciplined Dreaming framework, you will follow 5 steps to cultivate creativity for your personal or side projects:

* Ask
* Prepare
* Discover
* Ignite
* Launch

###Ask 
In this first stage, you define the problem you’re trying to solve and ask yourself how you will solve it. Here is where you'll start formulating your pitch and project template:

**Write:**
* **Overview:** What is the problem? Describe it and what specifically you/the client needs to solve
* **History:** What has led up to this point -- what has been tried before and what were the results? What impact will this background have on the project?
* **Objective:** What specific outcome are you the client trying to accomplish? How will success be measured?
* **Deliverable:** What is the physical output of this project -- what will the app look like? 
* **Target audience:** Whom will this message reach? What do we know about this audience, and how can we tailor the user experience appropriately?
* **Timeline:** Consider how you’ll need to set up your project management practices for the scope of this project

In working through the problem and its solution, consider these 3 questions:

* Why (this approach)?
* What if (something happens that you haven’t considered yet)?
* Why not (use a different approach)?

Pair up and share your pitches. Your partner will ask you those 3 questions. 

Takeaways: 

* What was difficult about this exercise?
* What questions are you wondering about now as we move to the next stage?

###Prepare
Make sure you’re ready to meet the challenge you’ve identified. Prepare every aspect of your mind, body, and environment to support maximum creative performance.

**Group Practice:** Improv storytelling! Someone starts the story with a phrase; the next person adds to the story by adding "because..." or "and..."

In this phase, watch out for these creativity killers:

* Groupthink: Asking for input is great; but don’t let your original focus become muddled with too many outside opinions -- hone in on what will actually help your project’s goal
* Distractions: There are always more problems that will crop up; document them and put them in a Parking Lot so that you can move on with your specific idea
* Overediting: Don’t focus on potential mistakes right now; that will derail this thought process

**Write:** Close your eyes and imagine an environment that would promote your creativity -- what does it look like? What does it feel like?

###Discover 
This stage is focused on breaking free of the ideas of “We’ve always done it this way” or “This is the usual approach” or “We don’t have the luxury of trying something new”

**Write:** Update your pitch based on takeaways from the Ask phase

**Partner pair up:** Use the Blocker technique -- pair up and share initial ideas with partner whose job is to passionately disagree with you

Share:

* How can you use this experience to explore your topic further?

###Ignite
Don’t be linear; Let your imagination run wild with inspiration for this project! 

Try some of these techniques:

* [8 rules of ideation](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/eight_rules_of_ideation.md)
* [SCAMPER](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/scamper.md)
* [The Opposite](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/the_opposite.md)

###Launch
Select your best ideas and put them into a plan using the project template

Focus on these questions:

* How do you sort the good ideas from the bad?
* How do you determine which ones to back and which ones to toss?
* How do you define success and measure the value you’ve created?

**Use these methods to decide on your idea(s):**

Pick Your Idea(s):

* Assign your ideas value:
	* Which means the most to you? Does it align with your personal passions and values?
	* Which idea excites you the most?
	* Which fits into the scope of a project timeline?

Test your Selection(s):

* Envision your MVP -- sketch it out! What would it be able to do? What would it look like?

Set your metrics:

* How will you measure success of your project? How will you monitor results?


Build your action plan:

* Finish your project template

Extension: 

* Come up with a project management plan to successfully execute this project
