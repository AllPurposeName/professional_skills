###Imbizo Groups (small group)
Using the Zulu expression for “gathering,” imbizo groups are gatherings of people from diverse backgrounds and disciplines who have come together to simply discuss an idea. These groups are freeform and have no specific end goal in mind, other than exploring. When you’re working to discuss and brainstorm new ideas, find a few people with diverse perspectives to have the discussion with. Remember that the key here is letting go of the outcome and simply allowing the discussion to ensue. 

###Hot Potato (small group)
Sit in a circle and designate a notetaker. Toss a ball or other object to a random person in the group, who must shout out one idea for a new or better app or service you could offer. The idea should be no more than a sentence long -- don’t analyze or contemplate the phrasing. The point is to think fast, which removes obstacles, blockers, and fear. Aim to do this for 15 minutes. 

###The Start Isn’t Always the Start
You don’t always have to start your project on “page one.” There’s a difference between starting to work and a creative project’s “beginning.” Approach your process from different points in the work -- whiteboard or sketch out the final result. Describe the experience as though you are the user to spark ideas on how the app should look and feel. Plan the end result and work backwards from there.

###The Wrong Answer
We are socialized not to make mistakes. But to kick off the creative process, try searching for the wrong answer instead of the right one. For example:

* “How could I have the worst UX/UI in this app?”
* “What is the most complicated route I could take to get to the endpoint?”
* “What would keep this project from being a demo finalist?”

These questions make the brainstorming process less threatening and will help lead you to the right answer.

###The Time Capsule
Envision your project from 50 years ago or further. How would people from that era approach this problem? Envision your project 50 years or further ahead in time. What ideas might you use from the vantage point of the future? Shifting your perspective to the past or the future can open up your mind with fresh ideas and help generate sparks to kick the creative process into high gear. 

###The Hemingway Bridge
Ernest Hemingway sometimes found that after finishing writing a chapter, he'd be creatively exhausted. It was hard for him to start the next chapter. To avoid this start-and-stop challenge, he began to write the first paragraph of the next chapter before ending his day's work. This became known as the Hemingway Bridge as he gave himself a head start to the next day's work. Use the Hemingway Bridge to keep the momentum going through your project -- bridge your ideas into the next element of your project to make picking it up later easier. 

###Personas
Different clients care about different things. To help yourself better target your pitch and overall message, create some client personas. 

Examples:

* Artsy Anna cares about visual design
* ROI Ronnie only cares about return on investment
* Data Dan wants to know about the research and data that is going into the project

Your project will have an impact on people, so use these personas to find different angles on your message. Think about your target audience and decide on its persona in detail -- this will help you refine your pitch.

###Provocation
Spark creative ideas by starting with a provocative (or "stupid") statement like, "Houses should not have roofs."  Start by exploring the consequences of that statement (*Would people carry umbrellas around?* *What would the benefits be?* *What would need to happen to make this happen?* *What sequence of events would need to change?*) The objective here is to generate sparks not fully formed ideas -- this will help you look at your project from a completely different angle. The absurd may quickly morph into your best ideas, so think of this as an incubator of original thought. 

###Dagnabbits
Keep an eye out for "dagnabbits" -- moments when you feel frustrated about a situation, product, or service. This flash of disappointment or frustration can make you wish the world were different. Keep a running list of these moments as a great source of creative sparks. Many of the greatest inventions came directly out of dagnabbit moments: 

* Pierre Omidyar founded eBay when he was frustrated that there was no easy way to build his Pez collection online. 
* Frederick Smith was outraged that there was no reliable way to send overnight packeages, so he launched FedEx. 
* Don Wetzel was upset that he couldn't withdraw cash from his bacnk account during nonbanking hours, so he invented the ATM.

Use dagnabbits to your advantage by thinking through, discussing, or observing your target audience in action. You can interview people who are deeply embedded in the problem you're trying to solve (customers, colleagues, investors, etc.). What are the pain points? What bottlenecks exist?

###TDWR (Think, Doodle, Write, Repeat)
A doodle, unlike a chart, diagram, or illustration, carries a whimsical, unfinished quality to it that makes it the ideal breeding ground for new ideas. A doodle is meant to be free-flowing and even sloppy. Let your mind wander without limitations as you doodle ideas. If you're a visual processor, this could be very beneficial to you. Spend an hour doing several cycles of TDWR in a free-flowing style. Don't edit, judge, plan, or even reread your doodles until you're done with the exercise.
