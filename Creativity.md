# Creativity: Building Habits & Frameworks

## Adapted from [Disciplined Dreaming by Josh Linkner](https://www.amazon.com/Disciplined-Dreaming-Proven-Breakthrough-Creativity/dp/1611203074)

Linker's suggested framework for driving creativity in your everyday life and in your teams and organizations follows these 5 phases:

    * Ask:
        * Identify the problem you would like to solve
        * Ask questions
        * Explore possibilities
        * Awaken curiosity and awareness
    * Prepare:
        * Ensure you're ready to meet the challenge you've identified 
        * Warm up your creativity muscles
        * Create an atmosphere for yourself or your team that is fun, surprising, and primed for cultivating creativity
    * Discover:
        * Explore every avenue that might lead to creative ideas
        * Challenge the ideas of "We've always done it that way" or "This is our usual approach"
    * Ignite:
        * Allow your ideas to flow freely in order to see what sparks. 
        * Utilize different techniques (listed below) to generate ideas and turn those "sparks" into "fires."
    * Launch:
        * Put your brainstorming into action
        * Select your best ideas
        * Determine key metrics for measurement
        * Build an action plan to bring your ideas to life
