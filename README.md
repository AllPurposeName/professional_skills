Learning how to tell your story based on the channel you’re using to communicate is important for successfully conveying how you’ll contribute to a team and the tech community. Think about how you’d like to contribute your prior experience and career to the tech community. How would you like to use your skills as a software developer? In this workshop we’ll talk through how the resume, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Github all contribute to telling your story and will support your job search.
