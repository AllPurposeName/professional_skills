# Professional ("Soft") Skills Curriculum & Resources

## Overview of Professional Skills Instruction at Turing
Professional Skills instruction at Turing is a three-fold focus:
  * Pre-Turing: Before students begin at Turing, they are given a survey to self-assess their soft skills. The Community Affairs Manager (Allison) will use this information to create initial plans for students. 
  * During Turing (Mods. 1-3): Allison will meet with students during each module to continue development on soft skills, either in small groups or in 1-on-1 meetings. Cohort-specific sessions called Protocol will be taught 
  * Preparing for Post-Turing (Mod. 4): In Module 4, students will meet with the Professional Development Coordinator (Marissa) and the Partnerships Manager (Lia) to discuss and create strategies for the search for jobs in the software industry.
