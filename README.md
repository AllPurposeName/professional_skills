# Professional Skills Curriculum & Resources

## Overview of Professional Skills Instruction at Turing
Professional Skills instruction at Turing is a three-fold focus:
  * Pre-Turing: 
     * Before students begin at Turing, they are given a survey to self-assess their professional skills. The Community Affairs Manager (Allison) will use this information to create initial action plans and suggestions for students. 
  * During Turing (Mods. 1-4): 
     * Allison will meet with students during each module to continue development on professional skills, either in small groups or in 1-on-1 meetings. 
     * In Module 1, students are also provided with the opportunity to take the [StrengthsFinder assessment](http://strengths.gallup.com/110440/About-StrengthsFinder-20.aspx), and Allison will discuss these results with students and assist in creating action plans to highlight strengths within professional development at Turing. Students may also participate in weekly StrengthsFinder lunches to continue the discussion (check the [Turing Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=casimircreative.com_ronr9dk92ndvlhsk03kf8jd2ro%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Denver) for most up-to-date listings of lunches). 
     * Each cohort will participate in 1-2 whole-group sessions each module on professional skills called Protocol to expand on skills that are most applicable to each module.  
  * Post-Turing (Alumni): 
     * Upon graduation, students are provided with opportunities to continue developing their professional skills through support sessions within our Turing Alumni Chapters and can attend any sessions or utilize any resources offered by Turing. 
     * Alumni are also welcome to set up meetings with Allison to finetune skills during their job search.
