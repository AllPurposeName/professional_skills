Learning how to tell your story based on the channel you’re using to communicate is important for successfully conveying how you’ll contribute to a team and the tech community. Think about how you’d like to contribute your prior experience and career to the tech community. How would you like to use your skills as a software developer? In this workshop we’ll talk through how the resume, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Github all contribute to telling your story and will support your job search.

At the end of this workshop you’ll have a resume specific for the tech industry, LinkedIn profile, Twitter account, and GitHub profile. 

###Learning how to Pair (led by Community Affairs Manager)
We do a lot of paired projects at Turing. Why? Because the software industry emphasizes pairing within its teams -- we want to mimic the industry as much as possible. To prepare you for working with others on big projects with tight deadlines, this session covers DTR (Defining the Relationship), a conversation that will help you set expectations with your partner(s), how to uphold those expectations, how to have crucial conversations when expectations are broken, how to give each other effective feedback, and how to take feedback
