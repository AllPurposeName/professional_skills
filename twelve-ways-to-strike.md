#Twelve Ways to Strike Sparks of Creativity
*(part of the Ignite phase of the Disciplined Dreaming framework for creativity)*

##Imbizo Groups (small group)
Using the Zulu expression for “gathering,” imbizo groups are gatherings of people from diverse backgrounds and disciplines who have come together to simply discuss an idea. These groups are freeform and have no specific end goal in mind, other than exploring. When you’re working to discuss and brainstorm new ideas, find a few people with diverse perspectives to have the discussion with. Remember that the key here is letting go of the outcome and simply allowing the discussion to ensue. 

##Hot Potato (small group)
Sit in a circle and designate a notetaker. Toss a ball or other object to a random person in the group, who must shout out one idea for a new or better app or service you could offer. The idea should be no more than a sentence long -- don’t analyze or contemplate the phrasing. The point is to think fast, which removes obstacles, blockers, and fear. Aim to do this for 15 minutes. 

##The Start Isn’t Always the Start
You don’t always have to start your project on “page one.” There’s a difference between starting to work and a creative project’s “beginning.” Approach your process from different points in the work -- whiteboard or sketch out the final result. Describe the experience as though you are the user to spark ideas on how the app should look and feel. Plan the end result and work backwards from there.

##The Wrong Answer
We are socialized not to make mistakes. But to kick off the creative process, try searching for the wrong answer instead of the right one. For example:

* “How could I have the worst UX/UI in this app?”
* “What is the most complicated route I could take to get to the endpoint?”
* “What would keep this project from being a demo finalist?”
These questions make the brainstorming process less threatening and will help lead you to the right answer.
