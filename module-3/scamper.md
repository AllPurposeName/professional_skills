# Creativity Exercise: SCAMPER

*(exercise adapted from the Ignite phase of the Disciplined Dreaming framework)*

###Overview
Advertiser Alex Osborn is credited with founding the idea of *brainstorming*. He also invented another technique: SCAMPER, which stands for:

**S**ubstitute

**C**ombine

**A**dapt

**M**agnify or minimize

**P**ut to other use

**E**liminate

**R**earrange or reverse

To use this technique, start with a concept and then try out different variations on the theme.

###Breaking It Down
Here's an example thinking about breakfast cereal:

**Substitute:** Corn Flakes led to Bran Flakes (substitute ingredient). Puffed Rice helped launch Rice Krispies (substitute preparation). Substitutions can also include people, physical locations, production processes, flavors, and distribution channels. *How could you think about substitution regarding software?*

**Combine:** Raisin Bran was born from combining bran flakes with raisins. What other combinations could you create? Cereal manufacturers are experts at this (Honey Nut Cheerios, Apple & Cinnamon Oatmeal). This step is about adding a new ingredient or combining two or more existing items into one. *What ideas could be combined to make an even better idea? What businesses could benefit from this type of software?*

**Adapt:** What could you adapt for your project? Cinnamon Toast Crunch came from borrowing the flavor of cinnamon toast and then adapting it into a cereal recipe. Cookie Crisp emerged from adapting the flavor of chocolate chip cookies.

**Magnify or minimize:** Frosted Wheat became Frosted Mini Wheats. Granola evolved into low-fat granola. A regular box of Wheaties now comes in a giant, family-sized box. *How can changing the scope of an idea or project change its outcomes?*

**Put to other use:** Rice Krispie Treats are now packaged in separate units and sold as a competitor to the candy bar. Corn Flakes can be used in dozens of recipes, including breading for chicken or stuffing. Its brand, Kellogg's, makes these recipes readily available and recommends the alternative uses. *What new uses could you discover through software for existing ideas or products?*

**Eliminate:** "Without nuts", "reduced fat", "sugar-free", "only whole grains", and other banners are now a mainstay of cereal production. Eliminating one or more aspects of an idea is a way to uncover brand new ideas. *How could you apply this to your project idea?*

**Rearrange or reverse:** Post launched Honey Bunches of Oats in 1989. Today, you can find it packaged with almonds, bananas, peaches, strawberries, chocolate clusters, cinnamon clusters, or vanilla clusters. What did Post do next? They launched Just Bunches, eliminating other elements of the cereal altogether. They built a cereal franchise around one original product idea. 

*How could variations of your idea enrich your project?*
