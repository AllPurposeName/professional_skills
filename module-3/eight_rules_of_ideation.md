# Creativity Exercise: Eight Rules of Ideation

(*adapted from the Ignite step of the Disciplined Dreaming Framework*)

###Don't Judge
Let your ideas flow. During the Ignite phase, no one is allowed to offer judgement on any idea. You'll have plenty of time to evaluate your ideas later.

###Don't Comment
Even if you or your team come up with the stupidest idea you've ever heard, let the process continue. Any negative comment or criticism will change the mood, and ideas will stop. 

###Don't Edit
Don't let your inner editor join the brainstorming session. At this point, the font choice, color palette, and idea name are irrelevant. Editing is a separate process from idea generation. You'll have plenty of time to edit later.

###Don't Execute
The second an idea makes it onto the whiteboard, you can easily become distracted by thinking about execution. You'll wonder how the idea will come to life. Avoid this instinct at this stage of the process in order to let the idea grow.

###Don't Worry
Fear is the single biggest blocker of creativity. Release fear in order to unshackle your true creative potential. If this is a team, create an environment where people feel comfortable taking risks and have no fear of embarrassment or negative consequences. Lead by example -- don't be afraid to come up with outrageous ideas and neither will your team. 

###Don't Look Backwards
Just because an idea might have "failed" before doesn't mean you shouldn't explore it. Don't let the past inhibit your thinking. Every idea is new at this moment.

###Don't Lose Focus
Idea sessions can sometimes break down into wandering, so don't get distracted. When side issues arise, add them to your Parking Lot. This keeps you focused on the task at hand while ensuring important topics will be discussed later.

###Don't Sap Energy
Keep the energy up. Don't check your phone or your clock (until your Pomodoro timer goes off) in order to stay engaged. Surround yourself with people who are positive and adding energy to your brainstorming session.
