# Turing Professional Development Pre-Work
## Developing Mindsets to Succeed
_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

When you're transitioning careers, often many other aspects of your approach to work and life undergo a transition as well. Turing aims to be a place where you can work through these transitions successfully. While enrolled at Turing and during your subsequent job search, you'll be provided with tools and strategies to develop the professional skills necessary to enter a new career as a software developer. 

The pre-work for professional development is focused on introducing you to a set of mindsets that we at Turing believe will make you a successful programmer. These mindsets are:

* Agency - Defined as taking initiative and ownership over your learning and work
* Empathy - Defined as understanding and sharing others' emotions in order to relate to them more
* Engagement - Defined as active participation
* Grit - Defined as a combination of perserverance and passion
* Growth - Defined as a belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. Resiliency is a key point for this mindset 

Your Gear Up pre-work is focused on Empathy, so that is not a focus of this pre-work while the other four mindsets will be introduced to you here. Your objectives in this pre-work are to:

* Understand the non-coding aspects that go into being a successful programmer
* Reflect on your current mindsets and build an understanding of new or differing mindsets 
* Reflect on organizational processes that would be useful for you in this career

### Directions: 
For the activities listed below, **please create a gist on GitHub to capture your reflections for each of these 3 parts.** 

1. Read through this post from Red Pill Programming to get a sense of the different mindsets you'll want to consider in your new career: [The Software Engineer Framework: 8 Ways to Become a Better Software Engineer](http://redpillprogramming.com/software-engineer-framework/). 

   * Approximate reading time: 15 minutes 
   * After reading, please write a reflection (4-6 sentences) on your takeaways from the post.
   
2. Mentioned in the first reading, the idea of a strong checklist is the focus in the second reading. Read through and/or listen to this [interview](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122226184) with Atul Gawande (author of the [Checklist Manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000)). It includes an excerpt from his book, which is optional reading. 
   
   * Approximate reading time (including the excerpt from the book, which is optional): 22 minutes
   * After reading, consider the idea of checklists. Write a reflection (4-6 sentences) on the benefits of a checklist and how an organizational system such as a checklist might help you first as a student and later as a full-time developer. 

3. Read through [29 Behaviors That Will Make You an Unstoppable Programmer](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/29-behaviors-will-make-unstoppable-programmer/)
   
   * Approximate reading time: 20 minutes
   * Pick out 3 behaviors that resonate with you in the list and describe why they resonate with you in a reflection (4-6 sentences).
