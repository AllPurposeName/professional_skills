# Turing Professional Development Pre-Work
When you're transitioning careers, often many other aspects of your approach to work and life undergo a transition. Turing aims to be a place where you can work through this transition successfully. While enrolled at Turing and during your subsequent job search, you'll be provided with tools and strategies to develop the professional skills necessary to be successful in the technology industry. 

The pre-work for professional development is focused on developing a set of mindsets that we at Turing feel will make you a successful programmer. These mindsets are:

* Agency
* Empathy
* Engagement
* Grit
* Growth

Your Gear Up pre-work is focused on Empathy, so that is not a focus of this pre-work while the other four mindsets will be introduced to you here. Your objectives in this pre-work are to      
-Goal One: Create a process for work flow and organization (Checklist and introduce Trello, etc.)
-Goal Two: Reflections on how you got here??

### Directions: 
For the activities listed below, please create a gist on GitHub to capture your reflections. 

1. Read through this post from Red Pill Programming to get a sense of the different mindsets you'll want to consider in your new career: [The Software Engineer Framework: 8 Ways to Become a Better Software Engineer](http://redpillprogramming.com/software-engineer-framework/). 

   * Approximate reading time: 15 minutes
